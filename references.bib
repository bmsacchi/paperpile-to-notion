                 explain this transition, some involving male and female

                 recombination between X and Y (or Z/W, U/V) chromosomes.

                 cytogenetically identical with the Y, harboring a megabase

                 chromosomes---but conservation of the master sex-determining
                 genes---characterize distantly related animal lineages. Yet in
                 plants, in which separate sexes have evolved repeatedly and
                 sex chromosomes are typically homomorphic, we do not know
                 whether such translocations drive sex-chromosome turnovers
                 within closely related taxonomic groups. This phenomenon can
                 only be demonstrated by identifying sex-associated nucleotide
                 sequences, still largely unknown in plants. The wild North
                 American octoploid strawberries (Fragaria) exhibit separate
                 sexes (dioecy) with homomorphic, female heterogametic (ZW)
                 inheritance, yet sex maps to three different chromosomes in
                 different taxa. To characterize these turnovers, we identified
                 sequences unique to females and assembled their reads into
                 contigs. For most octoploid Fragaria taxa, a short (13 kb)
                 sequence was observed in all females and never in males,
                 implicating it as the sex-determining region (SDR). This
                 female-specific ``SDR cassette'' contains both a gene with a
                 known role in fruit and pollen production and a novel
                 retrogene absent on Z and autosomal chromosomes. Phylogenetic
                 comparison of SDR cassettes revealed three clades and a
                 history of repeated translocation. Remarkably, the
                 translocations can be ordered temporally due to the capture of
                 adjacent sequence with each successive move. The accumulation
                 of the ``souvenir'' sequence---and the resultant expansion of
                 the hemizygous SDR over time---could have been adaptive by
                 locking genes into linkage with sex. Terminal inverted repeats
                 at the insertion borders suggest a means of movement. To our
                 knowledge, this is the first plant SDR shown to be
                 translocated, and it suggests a new mechanism
                 (``move-lock-grow'') for expansion and diversification of
                 incipient sex chromosomes.",

                 most common evolutionary transitions in flowering plants.
                 Until recently, however, a genome-wide view of this transition
                 has been obscured by both a dearth of appropriate data and the
                 lack of appropriate population genomic methods to interpret
                 such data. Here, we present a novel population genomic
                 analysis detailing the origin of the selfing species, Capsella
                 rubella, which recently split from its outcrossing sister,
                 Capsella grandiflora. Due to the recency of the split, much of
                 the variation within C. rubella is also found within C.
                 grandiflora. We can therefore identify genomic regions where
                 two C. rubella individuals have inherited the same or
                 different segments of ancestral diversity (i.e. founding
                 haplotypes) present in C. rubella's founder(s). Based on this
                 analysis, we show that C. rubella was founded by multiple
                 individuals drawn from a diverse ancestral population closely
                 related to extant C. grandiflora, that drift and selection
                 have rapidly homogenized most of this ancestral variation
                 since C. rubella's founding, and that little novel variation
                 has accumulated within this time. Despite the extensive loss
                 of ancestral variation, the approximately 25\% of the genome
                 for which two C. rubella individuals have inherited different
                 founding haplotypes makes up roughly 90\% of the genetic
                 variation between them. To extend these findings, we develop a
                 coalescent model that utilizes the inferred frequency of
                 founding haplotypes and variation within founding haplotypes
                 to estimate that C. rubella was founded by a potentially large
                 number of individuals between 50 and 100 kya, and has
                 subsequently experienced a twenty-fold reduction in its
                 effective population size. As population genomic data from an
                 increasing number of outcrossing/selfing pairs are generated,
                 analyses like the one developed here will facilitate a

                 ~117 Mb unique sequences, representing a substitution rate of

              viability selection on autosomal loci in humans using the largest
              cohort to date (UK Biobank, n = 487,999) along with a second
              large, independent cohort (BioVU, n = 93,864). We performed
              association tests between genetically ascertained sex and
              autosomal loci. Although we found dozens of genome-wide
              significant associations, none replicated across cohorts.
              Moreover, closer inspection revealed that all associations are
              likely due to cross-hybridization with sex chromosome regions
              during genotyping. We report loci with potential for
              mis-hybridization found on commonly used genotyping platforms
              that should be carefully considered in future genetic studies of
              sex-specific differences. Despite being well powered to detect
              allele frequency differences of up to 0.8\% between the sexes, we
              do not detect clear evidence for this signature of sexually
              antagonistic viability selection on autosomal variation. These
              findings suggest a lack of strong ongoing sexually antagonistic
              viability selection acting on single locus autosomal variation in
              humans.",

  abstract    = "Widespread loss of genes on the Y is considered a hallmark of
                 sex chromosome differentiation. Here we show that the initial
                 stages of Y evolution are driven by massive amplification of
                 distinct classes of genes. The neo-Y chromosome of Drosophila
                 miranda initially contained about 3,000 protein-coding genes,
                 but has gained over 3,200 genes since its formation about 1.5
                 million years ago primarily by tandem amplification of
                 protein-coding genes ancestrally present on this chromosome.
                 We show that distinct evolutionary processes may account for
                 this drastic increase in gene number on the Y. Testis-specific
                 and dosage-sensitive genes appear to have amplified on the Y
                 to increase male fitness. A distinct class of meiosis-related
                 multi-copy Y genes independently co-amplified on the X, and
                 their expansion is probably driven by conflicts over
                 segregation. Co-amplified X/Y genes are highly expressed in
                 testis, enriched for meiosis and RNA interference functions
                 and are frequently targeted by small RNAs in testis. This
                 suggests that their amplification is driven by X versus Y
                 antagonism for increased transmission, where sex chromosome
                 drive suppression is probably mediated by sequence homology
                 between the suppressor and distorter through the RNA
                 interference mechanism. Thus, our analysis suggests that newly
                 emerged sex chromosomes are a battleground for sexual and
                 meiotic conflict.",

                 same rationale, a pre-existing sex asymmetry in recombination
                 is expected to affect the evolution of heterogamety, for
                 example, a low rate of male recombination might favor
                 transitions to XY systems, by generating immediate linkage
                 between SD and SA genes. Furthermore, the accumulation of
                 deleterious mutations on nonrecombining Y chromosomes should
                 favor XY-to-XY transitions (which discard the decayed Y), but
                 disfavor XY-to-ZW transitions (which fix the decayed Y as an
                 autosome). Like many anuran amphibians, Hyla tree frogs have
                 been shown to display drastic heterochiasmy (males only
                 recombine at chromosome tips) and are typically XY, which
                 seems to fit the above expectations. Instead, here we
                 demonstrate that two species, H. sarda and H. savignyi, share
                 a common ZW system since at least 11 Ma. Surprisingly, the
                 typical pattern of restricted male recombination has been
                 maintained since then, despite female heterogamety. Hence, sex
                 chromosomes recombine freely in ZW females, not in ZZ males.
                 This suggests that heterochiasmy does not constrain
                 heterogamety (and vice versa), and that the role of SA genes
                 in the evolution of sex chromosomes might have been
                 overemphasized.",

                 Polygonaceae (Buckwheat) family of plants. A source of
                 intrigue for Rumex lies in the diversity of the reproductive
                 systems associated with the subgenera, species, and subspecies
                 within this genus. Four previously circumscribed subgenera,
                 some 200 species, and a number of subspecies comprise the
                 collective Rumex genus. These species exhibit monoecious,
                 dioecious, synoecious (hermaphroditic), and polygamous
                 reproductive systems. Moreover, some of the dioecious species
                 contain sex chromosomes, a phenomenon that is very rare in
                 angiosperms. Apart from the confirmed morphological and
                 phytogeographical distinctions, two of the four described
                 subgenera, Acetosa and Acetosella, are distinctive in their
                 exhibited sex chromosome systems. For this study, we used
                 three chloroplast markers, rbcL, trnH-psbA, trnL-F, and dense
                 taxon sampling, to reconstruct a molecular phylogeny for
                 Rumex.The reconstructed phylogeny for this work resolves six
                 major clades and one large grade in Rumex. In addition, the
                 species with known dioecious reproductive systems derived from
                 unique sex chromosome systems are resolved in two different
                 clades nested within ``the dioecious clade''. These results
                 suggest that the species with divergent sexual systems are
                 more closely related to each other than to other species
                 comprising the rest of the Rumex genus. Furthermore, some
                 species with known synoecious reproductive systems are
                 resolved in a single clade which is also nested within ``the
                 dioecious clade''. These results imply a possible reversal

  abstract    = "We studied the evolution of RAE180 satellite DNA family in the
                 North American endemic dioecious plant Rumex hastatulus. In
                 this species, the Texas race is characterized by a single
                 XX/XY sex chromosome system, whereas the North Carolina race
                 has evolved a derived complex XX/XY1Y2 sex chromosome system.
                 RAE180 repeats were autosomic and poorly represented (2
                 $\times$ 10-4 \% of the genome) with no differences between
                 individuals of different genders or different races of R.
                 hastatulus. In fact, the sex chromosomes of the North Carolina
                 race are still euchromatic, and they have not accumulated
                 satellite DNA sequences, which contrasts with that occurring
                 in the rest of dioecious XX/XY1Y2 Rumex species. In R.
                 hastatulus, we detected the existence of three RAE180
                 subfamilies. Notwithstanding, while in the Texas race the TX1/
                 NC1 subfamily is the most frequent, the TX2/NC2 subfamily is
                 the most abundant in the North Carolina race. Additionally,
                 the third, less represented subfamily (TX3/NC3) appears
                 currently as relict sequences in both genomes. A common
                 feature of RAE180 satellite is the sudden replacement of one
                 sequence variant by another in different species (or
                 populations as in R. hastatulus races). Thus, the phylogenetic
                 analysis of RAE180 repeats from six dioecious Rumex species
                 supports the ``li-brary'' hypothesis. According to this
                 hypothesis, we assume that a set of divergent RAE180 variants
                 were present in the ancestral genome of dioecious Rumex
                 species, from which novel tandem arrays originated by the
                 amplification of different variants in different lineages.
                 Differential levels of RAE180 satellite DNA amplification in
                 each lineage, at different evolutionary times, and in
                 different chromosomal positions gave rise to differential
                 patterns of sequence evolution. R{\'e}sum{\'e} : Les auteurs

                 use sequencing, Hi-C3,4 and linkage mapping to assemble a
                 chromosome-scale genome reference. The linkage map reveals an
                 extremely low rate of recombination on chromosome 1. We
                 confirm suppression of recombination on chromosome 1 by
                 genotyping individual sperm cells and oocytes. We show that
                 previously identified genomic regions that maintain
                 heterozygosity even after prolonged inbreeding make up
                 essentially all of chromosome 1. Genome sequencing of
                 individuals isolated in the wild indicates that this
                 phenomenon has evolved specifically in populations from
                 Sardinia and Corsica. We find that most known master
                 regulators5-13 of the reproductive system are located on
                 chromosome 1. We used RNA interference14,15 to knock down a
                 gene with haplotype-biased expression, which led to the
                 formation of a more pronounced female mating organ. On the
                 basis of these observations, we propose that chromosome 1 is a
                 sex-primed autosome primed for evolution into a sex
                 chromosome.",

  abstract    = "BACKGROUND: Whole genomes are commonly assembled into a
                 collection of scaffolds and often lack annotations of
                 autosomes, sex chromosomes, and organelle genomes (i.e.,
                 mitochondrial and chloroplast). As these chromosome types
                 differ in effective population size and can have highly
                 disparate evolutionary histories, it is imperative to take
                 this information into account when analysing genomic
                 variation. Here we assessed the accuracy of four methods for
                 identifying the homogametic sex chromosome in a small
                 population using two whole genome sequences (WGS) and 133 RAD
                 sequences of white-tailed eagles (Haliaeetus albicilla): i)
                 difference in read depth per scaffold in a male and a female,
                 ii) heterozygosity per scaffold in a male and a female, iii)
                 mapping to the reference genome of a related species (chicken)
                 with annotated sex chromosomes, and iv) analysis of
                 SNP-loadings from a principal components analysis (PCA), based
                 on the low-depth RADseq data. RESULTS: The best performing
                 approach was the reference mapping (method iii), which
                 identified 98.12\% of the expected homogametic sex chromosome
                 (Z). Read depth per scaffold (method i) identified 86.41\% of
                 the homogametic sex chromosome with few false positives.
                 SNP-loading scores (method iv) identified 78.6\% of the
                 Z-chromosome and had a false positive discovery rate of more
                 than 10\%. Heterozygosity per scaffold (method ii) did not
                 provide clear results due to a lack of diversity in both the Z
                 and autosomal chromosomes, and potential interference from the
                 heterogametic sex chromosome (W). The evaluation of these
                 methods also revealed 10 Mb of putative PAR and gametologous
                 regions. CONCLUSION: Identification of the homogametic sex
                 chromosome in a small population is best accomplished by
                 reference mapping or examining differences in read depth

                 thought, being shared not only with its sister species,
                 Poecilia wingei, but also with Poecilia picta, which diverged

                 picta are completely nonrecombining and strikingly

                 Males of the freshwater fish Poecilia parae occur as one of
                 five discrete morphs, all of which shoal together in natural
                 populations where morph frequency has been stable for over 50
                 years. Each morph uses a different complex reproductive
                 strategy and morphs differ dramatically in colour, body size
                 and mating behaviour. Morph phenotype is passed perfectly from
                 father to son, indicating there are five Y haplotypes

                 animals and plants. In a few species, sex is determined
                 epigenetically through the action of Y-encoded small RNAs.
                 Epigenetics is also responsible for changing the sex of
                 individuals through time, even in species that carry sex
                 chromosomes, and could favour species adaptation through
                 breeding system plasticity. The Y chromosome accumulates
                 repeats that become epigenetically silenced which leads to an
                 epigenetic conflict with the expression of Y genes and could
                 accelerate Y degeneration. Y heterochromatin can be lost
                 through ageing, which activates transposable elements and
                 lowers male longevity. Y chromosome degeneration has led to
                 the evolution of meiotic sex chromosome inactivation in
                 eutherians (placentals) and marsupials, and dosage

                 convergently evolved in eutherians and marsupials via two
                 independently evolved non-coding RNAs. In Drosophila, male X
                 upregulation by the male specific lethal (MSL) complex can
                 spread to neo-X chromosomes through the transposition of

                 difficult to study how the complex regulatory mechanisms
                 underlying chromosome-wide dosage compensation can evolve. The
                 sex chromosomes of Poecilia picta have undergone recent and
                 rapid divergence, resulting in widespread gene loss on the
                 male Y, coupled with complete X chromosome dosage
                 compensation, the first case reported in a fish. The de novo
                 origin of a novel dosage compensation system presents a unique
                 opportunity to discover new mechanisms of gene regulation and
                 their evolutionary origins. By combining a new
                 chromosome-level assembly of P. picta with whole-genome
                 bisulfite sequencing and RNA-Seq data, we determine that the

                 systems and frequent sex chromosome turnovers. However,
                 compared with poplars, the diversity of sex determination in
                 willows is poorly understood, and little is known about the
                 evolutionary forces driving their turnover. Here, we
                 characterized the sex determination in two Salix species, S.
                 chaenomeloides and S. arbutifolia, which have an XY system on
                 chromosome 7 and 15, respectively. RESULTS: Based on the
                 assemblies of their sex determination regions, we found that
                 the sex determination mechanism of willows may have underlying
                 similarities with poplars, both involving intact and/or
                 partial homologs of a type A cytokinin response regulator (RR)
                 gene. Comparative analyses suggested that at least two sex
                 turnover events have occurred in Salix, one preserving the
                 ancestral pattern of male heterogamety, and the other changing
                 heterogametic sex from XY to ZW, which could be partly
                 explained by the ``deleterious mutation load'' and ``sexually
                 antagonistic selection'' theoretical models. We hypothesize
                 that these repeated turnovers keep sex chromosomes of willow
                 species in a perpetually young state, leading to limited
                 degeneration. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings further improve the
                 evolutionary trajectory of sex chromosomes in Salicaceae
                 species, explore the evolutionary forces driving the repeated

                 nearly all eukaryotic systems. These challenges range from
                 studying the evolution of chromosome structure, to finding
                 candidate genes for quantitative trait loci, to testing
                 hypotheses about speciation and adaptation. Here, we present
                 GENESPACE, which addresses these challenges by integrating
                 conserved gene order and orthology to define the expected
                 physical position of all genes across multiple genomes. We
                 demonstrate this utility by dissecting presence--absence,
                 copy-number, and structural variation at three levels of
                 biological organization: spanning 300 million years of
                 vertebrate sex chromosome evolution, across the diversity of
                 the Poaceae (grass) plant family, and among 26 maize
                 cultivars. The methods to build and visualize syntenic
                 orthology in the GENESPACE R package offer a significant
                 addition to existing gene family and synteny programs,
                 especially in polyploid, outbred, and other complex genomes.",

                 regions that have expanded stepwise, generating ``evolutionary
                 strata'' of differentiation. The reasons for this remain
                 poorly understood, but the principal hypotheses proposed to
                 date are based on antagonistic selection due to differences
                 between sexes. However, it has proved difficult to obtain
                 empirical evidence of a role for sexually antagonistic
                 selection in extending recombination suppression, and
                 antagonistic selection has been shown to be unlikely to
                 account for the evolutionary strata observed on fungal
                 mating-type chromosomes. We show here, by mathematical
                 modeling and stochastic simulation, that recombination
                 suppression on sex chromosomes and around supergenes can
                 expand under a wide range of parameter values simply because
                 it shelters recessive deleterious mutations, which are
                 ubiquitous in genomes. Permanently heterozygous alleles, such
                 as the male-determining allele in XY systems, protect linked
                 chromosomal inversions against the expression of their
                 recessive mutation load, leading to the successive
                 accumulation of inversions around these alleles without
                 antagonistic selection. Similar results were obtained with
                 models assuming recombination-suppressing mechanisms other
                 than chromosomal inversions and for supergenes other than sex
                 chromosomes, including those without XY-like asymmetry, such
                 as fungal mating-type chromosomes. However, inversions
                 capturing a permanently heterozygous allele were found to be
                 less likely to spread when the mutation load segregating in
                 populations was lower (e.g., under large effective population
                 sizes or low mutation rates). This may explain why sex
                 chromosomes remain homomorphic in some organisms but are
                 highly divergent in others. Here, we model a simple and
                 testable hypothesis explaining the stepwise extensions of

                 developmental defects responsible for intrinsic post-zygotic
                 reproductive isolation. Both cis- and trans-acting regulatory
                 divergence can be hastened by directional selection through
                 adaptation, sexual selection, and inter-sexual conflict, in
                 addition to cryptic evolution under stabilizing selection.
                 Dysfunctional sex-biased gene expression, in particular, may
                 provide an important source of sexually-dimorphic genetic
                 incompatibilities. Here, we characterize and compare male and
                 female/hermaphrodite transcriptome profiles for sibling
                 nematode species Caenorhabditis briggsae and C. nigoni, along
                 with allele-specific expression in their F1 hybrids, to
                 deconvolve features of expression divergence and regulatory
                 dysfunction. Despite evidence of widespread stabilizing
                 selection on gene expression, misexpression of sex-biased
                 genes pervades F1 hybrids of both sexes. This finding
                 implicates greater fragility of male genetic networks to
                 produce dysfunctional organismal phenotypes. Spermatogenesis
                 genes are especially prone to high divergence in both
                 expression and coding sequences, consistent with a ``faster
                 male'' model for Haldane's rule and elevated sterility of
                 hybrid males. Moreover, underdominant expression pervades
                 male-biased genes compared to female-biased and sex-neutral
                 genes and an excess of cis-trans compensatory regulatory
                 divergence for X-linked genes underscores a ``large-X effect''
                 for hybrid male expression dysfunction. Extensive regulatory
                 divergence in sex determination pathway genes likely
                 contributes to demasculinization of XX hybrids. The evolution
                 of genetic incompatibilities due to regulatory versus coding
                 sequence divergence, however, are expected to arise in an
                 uncorrelated fashion. This study identifies important
                 differences between the sexes in how regulatory networks

                 These include size differences, creating chromosomal
                 heteromorphism, and loss of gene functions from one member of
                 the chromosome pair. Such characteristics and changes have
                 been widely reviewed, and underlie molecular genetic
                 approaches that can detect sex chromosome regions. This review
                 deals mainly with the evolution of new non-recombining
                 regions, focusing on how certain evolutionary situations
                 select for suppressed recombination (rather than the proximate
                 mechanisms causing suppressed recombination between sex

  abstract    = "Cytological data from flowering plants suggest that the
                 evolution of recombination rates is affected by the mating
                 system of organisms, as higher chiasma frequencies are often
                 observed in self-fertilizing species compared with their
                 outcrossing relatives. Understanding the evolutionary cause of
                 this effect is of particular interest, as it may shed light on
                 the selective forces favoring recombination in natural
                 populations. While previous models showed that inbreeding may
                 have important effects on selection for recombination,
                 existing analytical treatments are restricted to the case of
                 loosely linked loci and weak selfing rates, and ignore the
                 effect of genetic interference (Hill-Robertson effect), known
                 to be an important component of selection for recombination in
                 randomly mating populations. In this article, we derive
                 general expressions quantifying the stochastic and
                 deterministic components of selection acting on a mutation
                 affecting the genetic map length of a whole chromosome along
                 which deleterious mutations occur, valid for arbitrary selfing
                 rates. The results show that selfing generally increases
                 selection for recombination caused by interference among
                 mutations as long as selection against deleterious alleles is
                 sufficiently weak. While interference is often the main driver
                 of selection for recombination under tight linkage or high
                 selfing rates, deterministic effects can play a stronger role
                 under intermediate selfing rates and high recombination,
                 selecting against recombination in the absence of epistasis,
                 but favoring recombination when epistasis is negative.
                 Individual-based simulation results indicate that our
                 analytical model often provides accurate predictions for the
                 strength of selection on recombination under partial selfing.
                 AUTHOR SUMMARY Understanding the evolutionary advantage of sex
                 and the associated process of meiotic recombination remains a
                 major challenge in evolutionary biology. Useful insights on
                 this question may possibly be gained from exploring the causes
                 of genetic variation for recombination rates within and
                 between species. In particular, a remarkable pattern observed
                 in flowering plants is that self-fertilizing species tend to
                 have higher rates of meiotic crossovers than their outcrossing
                 relatives. In this article, we use analytical and simulation
                 methods to investigate how selfing affects the sign and
                 magnitude of stochastic and deterministic components of
                 selection for recombination in hermaphroditic organisms. The
                 results show that, while selection for recombination vanishes
                 under complete selfing (as recombination has no genetic effect
                 in fully homozygous individuals), it is often maximized for
                 selfing rates slightly below one. This is primarily due to the
                 fact that selfing increases the strength of selective
                 interference among loci in finite populations, and may explain
                 the higher crossover rates observed in inbred plant species.

                 gameto-genesis to bias their own transmission into the next
                 generation of off-spring. Such tinkering can have significant
                 consequences on gameto-genesis and end up hampering the spread
                 of the driver. In Drosophila affrnis , sex-ratio meiotic drive
                 is caused by an X-linked complex that, when in males with a
                 susceptible Y chromosome, results in broods that are more than
                 95\% female. Interestingly, D. affrnis males lacking a Y
                 chromosome (XO) are fertile and males with the meiotic drive X
                 and no Y produce only sons - effectively reversing the
                 sex-ratio effect. Here, we show that meiotic drive
                 dramatically increases the rate of nondisjunction of the Y
                 chromosome (at least 50X), meaning that the driver is creating
                 resistant alleles through the process of driving. We then
                 model how the O might influence the spread, dynamics and
                 equilibrium of the sex-ratio X chromosome. We find that the O
                 can prevent the spread or reduce the equilibrium frequency of
                 the sex-ratio X chromosome and it can even lead to
                 oscillations in frequency. Finally, with reasonable
                 parameters, the O is unlikely to lead to the loss of the Y
                 chromosome, but we discuss how it might lead to sex-chromosome

                 evolution of reproductive isolation in wild populations.
                 Although several recent investigations have found that the
                 formation of neo-sex chromosomes is associated with
                 reproductive isolation, the mechanisms remain unclear in most
                 cases. Here, we assess the contemporary structure of gene flow
                 in the contact zone between largely allopatric cytotypes of
                 the dioecious plant Rumex hastatulus, a species in which there
                 is evidence of sex chromosome turn-over. Males to the west of
                 the Mississippi river, USA, have an X and a single Y
                 chromosome, whereas populations to the east of the river have
                 undergone a chromosomal rearrangement giving rise to a larger
                 X and two Y chromosomes. Using reduced-representation
                 sequencing, we provide evidence that hybrids form readily and
                 survive multiple backcross generations in the field,
                 demonstrating the potential for ongoing gene flow between the
                 cytotypes. At the scale of chromosomes, cline analysis of each
                 chromosome separately captured no signals of difference in
                 cline shape between chromosomes. However, when comparing SNPs,
                 principal component regression revealed a significant increase
                 in the contribution of individual SNPs to inter-cytotype
                 differentiation on the neo-X, but no correlation with
                 recombination rate. Cline analysis revealed that the only SNPs
                 with significantly shallower clines than the genome-average
                 were located on the neo-X. Our data are consistent with a role
                 for the neo-sex chromosome in reproductive isolation between
                 R. hastatulus cytotypes. Our investigation highlights the
                 importance of studying plant hybrid zones in species with sex
                 chromosomes for understanding mechanisms of reproductive
                 isolation and for understanding the role of gene flow in

                 ancestral Y chromosome and switch in the localization of 5S
                 rDNA, from autosomes to sex chromosomes (X and Y2). Two

                 suppression. To evaluate these possibilities, we constructed
                 linkage maps and a chromosome-scale genome assembly for the
                 dioecious plant Rumex hastatulus. This species has a
                 polymorphic karyotype with a young neo-sex chromosome,
                 resulting from a Robertsonian fusion between the X chromosome
                 and an autosome, in part of its geographic range. We
                 identified the shared and neo-sex chromosomes using
                 comparative genetic maps of the two cytotypes. We found that
                 sex-linked regions of both the ancestral and the neo-sex
                 chromosomes are embedded in large regions of low
                 recombination. Furthermore, our comparison of the
                 recombination landscape of the neo-sex chromosome to its

                 mainly preceded sex linkage. These patterns are not unique to
                 the sex chromosomes; all chromosomes were characterized by
                 massive regions of suppressed recombination spanning most of
                 each chromosome. This represents an extreme case of the
                 periphery-biased recombination seen in other systems with
                 large chromosomes. Across all chromosomes, gene and repetitive
                 sequence density correlated with recombination rate, with
                 patterns of variation differing by repetitive element type.
                 Our findings suggest that ancestrally low rates of

                 We investigated these predictions in the dioecious plant Rumex

                 sex chromosomes leads to dosage compensation mechanisms to
                 restore balanced expression between the X and the autosomes.
                 In Drosophila melanogaster, upregulation of the male X leads
                 to dosage compensation. It has been hypothesized that mammals
                 likewise upregulate their active X chromosome. Together with X
                 inactivation, this mechanism would maintain balanced
                 expression between the X chromosome and autosomes and between
                 the sexes. Here, we show that doubling of the global
                 expression level of the X chromosome leads to dosage
                 compensation in somatic tissues from several mammalian
                 species. X-linked genes are highly expressed in brain tissues,

                 chromosomes and two autosome sets (XX;AA), while males have a
                 single X chromosome and two autosome sets (X;AA). Drosophila
                 male somatic cells compensate for a single copy of the X
                 chromosome by deploying male-specific-lethal (MSL) complexes
                 that increase transcription from the X chromosome. Male germ
                 cells lack MSL complexes, indicating that either germline
                 X-chromosome dosage compensation is MSL-independent, or that
                 germ cells do not carry out dosage compensation. RESULTS: To
                 investigate whether dosage compensation occurs in germ cells,
                 we directly assayed X-chromosome transcripts using DNA
                 microarrays and show equivalent expression in XX;AA and X;AA
                 germline tissues. In X;AA germ cells, expression from the
                 single X chromosome is about twice that of a single autosome.
                 This mechanism ensures balanced X-chromosome expression
                 between the sexes and, more importantly, it ensures balanced
                 expression between the single X chromosome and the autosome
                 set. Oddly, the inactivation of an X chromosome in mammalian
                 females reduces the effective X-chromosome dose and means that
                 females face the same X-chromosome transcript deficiency as
                 males. Contrary to most current dosage-compensation models, we
                 also show increased X-chromosome expression in X;AA and XX;AA
                 somatic cells of Caenorhabditis elegans and mice. CONCLUSION:
                 Drosophila germ cells compensate for X-chromosome dose. This
                 occurs by equilibrating X-chromosome and autosome expression
                 in X;AA cells. Increased expression of the X chromosome in
                 X;AA individuals appears to be phylogenetically conserved.",

                 empirical or theoretical justification in assuming that it is
                 the driving force in all cases of sex chromosome evolution. In
                 many species, sex chromosomes have diverged in size and shape
                 through the accumulation of mutations in regions of suppressed
                 recombination. It is commonly assumed that recombination is
                 suppressed in sex chromosomes due to selection to resolve
                 sexually antagonistic pleiotropy. However, the requirement for
                 a sex chromosome-specific mechanism for suppressing
                 recombination is questionable, since more general models of
                 recombination suppression on autosomes also appear to be
                 applicable to sex chromosomes. Direct tests of the predictions

                 fertile XY females live alongside XX females and XY males.
                 These systems are regarded as evolutionary paradoxes because
                 of the production of sex-reversed individuals and non-viable
                 embryos, but they nevertheless seem stable over evolutionary
                 time. Several hypotheses have been proposed to account for
                 their stability, including models involving sex chromosome
                 drive ( i . e ., biased transmission of sex chromosomes to the
                 next generation). Here we corroborate this hypothesis in Mus
                 minutoides , a close relative of the house mouse in which the
                 presence of XY females is due to the evolution of a third sex
                 chromosome: a feminizing X. Through extensive molecular sexing
                 of pups at weaning, we reveal the existence of a remarkable
                 male sex chromosome drive system in this species, whereby
                 direction and strength of drive is conditional upon the
                 genotype of males' partners: males transmit their Y to almost
                 80\% of their offspring when mating with XX females, and only
                 36\% when mating with XY females. Using mathematical
                 modelling, we explore the joint evolution of these unusual
                 sex-determining and drive systems, revealing that different
                 sequences of events could have led to the evolution of this
                 bizarre system, and that the ``conditional'' nature of sex
                 chromosome drive stabilizes the feminizing X, and even
                 precludes a return to a standard XX/XY system. \#\#\#

  abstract    = "DNA introgressed from one species into another is typically
                 deleterious at many genomic loci in the recipient species. It
                 is therefore purged by selection over time. Here, we use
                 mathematical modeling and whole-genome simulations to study
                 the influence of recombination on the purging of introgressed
                 DNA. We find that aggregate recombination controls the
                 genome-wide rate of purging in the first few generations after
                 admixture, when purging is most rapid. Aggregate recombination
                 is quantified by ![Graphic][1], the average recombination rate
                 across all locus pairs, and analogous metrics. It is
                 influenced by the number of crossovers (i.e., the map length)
                 and their locations along chromosomes, and by the number of
                 chromosomes and heterogeneity in their size. A comparative
                 prediction of our analysis is that species with fewer
                 chromosomes should purge introgressed DNA more profoundly, and
                 therefore should exhibit a weaker genomic signal of historical
                 introgression. With regard to patterns across the genome, we
                 show that, in heterogametic species with autosomal
                 recombination in both sexes, more purging is expected on sex
                 chromosomes than on autosomes, all else equal. The opposite
                 prediction holds for species without autosomal recombination
                 in the heterogametic sex. Finally, we show that positive
                 genomic correlations between local recombination rate and
                 introgressed ancestry, as recently observed in several taxa,
                 are likely driven not by recombination's effect in unlinking
                 neutral from deleterious introgressed alleles, but rather by
                 its effect on the rate of purging of the deleterious alleles
                 themselves. Note on this version An earlier version of this

                 repeatedly throughout nature, with important implications for
                 their subsequent evolution. Explanations for this remarkable
                 convergence have generally invoked only adaptive processes
                 (e.g. sexually antagonistic selection); however, there is
                 still little evidence for these hypotheses. Here we propose a
                 model in which recombination on sex chromosomes is lost due to
                 the neutral accumulation of sequence divergence adjacent to
                 (and thus, in linkage disequilibrium with) the sex determiner.
                 Importantly, we include in our model the fact that sequence
                 divergence, in any form, reduces the probability of
                 recombination between any two sequences. Using simulations, we
                 show that, under certain conditions, a region of suppressed
                 recombination arises and expands outwards from the
                 sex-determining locus, under purely neutral processes.
                 Further, we show that the rate and pattern of recombination
                 loss are sensitive to the pre-existing recombination landscape
                 of the genome and to sex differences in recombination rates,

                 and male meiosis in most species has been a genetic enigma
                 since the early study of meiosis. Some hypotheses have been
                 put forward to explain this widespread phenomenon and, up to
                 now, only one fact has emerged clearly: In species in which
                 meiosis is achiasmate in one sex, it is the heterogametic one.
                 This pattern, known as the Haldane-Huxley rule, is thought to
                 be a side effect, on autosomes, of the suppression of
                 recombination between the sex chromosomes. However, this rule
                 does not hold for heterochiasmate species (i.e., species in
                 which recombination is present in both sexes but varies
                 quantitatively between sexes) and does not apply to species
                 lacking sex chromosomes, such as hermaphroditic plants. In
                 this paper, we show that in plants, heterochiasmy is due to a
                 male-female difference in gametic selection and is not
                 influenced by the presence of heteromorphic sex chromosomes.
                 This finding provides strong empirical support in favour of a

                 segregation during gamete production, and thus for fertility.
                 Strikingly, although in most species only one crossover event
                 per chromosome is required to ensure proper segregation,
                 recombination rates vary considerably above this minimum and

                 variation in recombination is adaptive or neutral and what

                 repeated evolution was random, or whether some ancestral
                 syntenic blocks have significantly higher chance to be
                 co-opted for the role of sex chromosomes owing to their gene
                 content related to gonad development. Here, we summarize
                 current knowledge on the evolutionary history of sex
                 determination and sex chromosomes in amniotes and evaluate the

  abstract    = "With or without sex chromosomes, sex determination is a
                 synthesis of many molecular events that drives a community of
                 cells towards a coordinated tissue fate. In this review, we
                 will consider how a sex determination pathway can be engaged
                 and stabilized without an inherited genetic determinant. In
                 many reptilian species, no sex chromosomes have been
                 identified, yet a conserved network of gene expression is
                 initiated. Recent studies propose that epigenetic regulation
                 mediates the effects of temperature on these genes through
                 dynamic post-transcriptional, post-translational and metabolic
                 pathways. It is likely that there is no singular regulator of
                 sex determination, but rather an accumulation of molecular
                 events that shift the scales towards one fate over another
                 until a threshold is reached sufficient to maintain and
                 stabilize one pathway and repress the alternative pathway.
                 Investigations into the mechanism underlying sex determination
                 without sex chromosomes should focus on cellular processes
                 that are frequently activated by multiple stimuli or can
                 synthesize multiple inputs and drive a coordinated response.

                 postzygotically (sex-differential sporophytic mortality) but
                 also prezygotically, because the sex ratio of seeds is also

                 of flowering plants. The mechanisms underlying female bias in
                 Rumex seeds are only poorly understood. To gain more knowledge

                 grains, with lower and with higher DNA amounts (16.8\%

                 lower DNA amount possess seven chromosomes, and grains with
                 the higher DNA amount eight of them. The quantitative ratio of
                 these grains in anthers at anthesis was 1:1.2, very close to

                 spacers and chloroplast intergenic sequences of 31 species of
                 Rumex. Our phylogenetic analysis supports a systematic
                 classification of the genus, which differs from that currently
                 accepted. In contrast to the current view, this new phylogeny
                 suggests a common origin for all Eurasian and American
                 dioecious species of Rumex, with gynodioecy as an intermediate

  abstract    = "BACKGROUND: S. latifolia is a model organism for the study of
                 sex chromosome evolution in plants. Its sex chromosomes
                 include large regions in which recombination became gradually
                 suppressed. The regions tend to expand over time resulting in
                 the formation of evolutionary strata. Non-recombination and
                 later accumulation of repetitive sequences is a putative cause
                 of the size increase in the Y chromosome. Gene decay and
                 accumulation of repetitive DNA are identified as key
                 evolutionary events. Transposons in the X and Y chromosomes
                 are distributed differently and there is a regulation of
                 transposon insertion by DNA methylation of the target
                 sequences, this points to an important role of DNA methylation
                 during sex chromosome evolution in Silene latifolia. The aim
                 of this study was to elucidate whether the reduced expression
                 of the Y allele in S. latifolia is caused by genetic
                 degeneration or if the cause is methylation triggered by
                 transposons and repetitive sequences. RESULTS: Gene expression
                 analysis in S. latifolia males has shown expression bias in
                 both X and Y alleles. To determine whether these differences
                 are caused by genetic degeneration or methylation spread by
                 transposons and repetitive sequences, we selected several
                 sex-linked genes with varying degrees of degeneration and from
                 different evolutionary strata. Immunoprecipitation of
                 methylated DNA (MeDIP) from promoter, exon and intron regions
                 was used and validated through bisulfite sequencing. We found
                 DNA methylation in males, and only in the promoter of genes of
                 stratum I (older). The Y alleles in genes of stratum I were
                 methylation enriched compared to X alleles. There was also
                 abundant and high percentage methylation in the CHH context in
                 most sequences, indicating de novo methylation through the
                 RdDM pathway. CONCLUSIONS: We speculate that TE accumulation
                 and not gene decay is the cause of DNA methylation in the S.

                 compensation. Our finding has striking resemblance to the

                 related species. Some species of animals and plants change sex
                 across their lifespan, some contain hermaphrodites as well as
                 males and females, some determine sex with highly
                 differentiated chromosomes, while others determine sex
                 according to their environment. Testing evolutionary
                 hypotheses regarding the causes and consequences of this
                 diversity requires interspecific data placed in a phylogenetic
                 context. Such comparative studies have been hampered by the
                 lack of accessible data listing sexual systems and sex
                 determination mechanisms across the eukaryotic tree of life.

                 little is known of the evolutionary drivers of chromosomal
                 fusions. Because sex chromosomes (X and Y in male
                 heterogametic systems, Z and W in female heterogametic
                 systems) differ in their selective, mutational, and
                 demographic environments, those differences provide a unique
                 opportunity to dissect the evolutionary forces that drive
                 chromosomal fusions. We estimate the rate at which fusions
                 between sex chromosomes and autosomes become established
                 across the phylogenies of both fishes and squamate reptiles.
                 Both the incidence among extant species and the establishment
                 rate of Y-autosome fusions is much higher than for X-autosome,
                 Z-autosome, or W-autosome fusions. Using population genetic
                 models, we show that this pattern cannot be reconciled with
                 many standard explanations for the spread of fusions. In
                 particular, direct selection acting on fusions or sexually
                 antagonistic selection cannot, on their own, account for the
                 predominance of Y-autosome fusions. The most plausible
                 explanation for the observed data seems to be (a) that fusions
                 are slightly deleterious, and (b) that the mutation rate is
                 male-biased or the reproductive sex ratio is female-biased. We
                 identify other combinations of evolutionary forces that might
                 in principle account for the data although they appear less
                 likely. Our results shed light on the processes that drive

                 because the evolutionary forces that fix the primary
                 sex-determining gene cause genic degeneration and accumulation
                 of junk DNA in the heterogametic partner. One of the most
                 spectacular phenomena in sex chromosome evolution is the
                 occurrence of neo-Y chromosomes, which lead to X1X2Y
                 sex-determining systems. Such neo-sex chromosomes are critical
                 for understanding the processes of sex chromosome evolution
                 because they rejuvenate their total gene content. We assembled
                 the male and female genomes at the chromosome level of the
                 spotted knifejaw (Oplegnathus punctatus), which has a
                 cytogenetically recognized neo-Y chromosome. The full assembly
                 and annotation of all three sex chromosomes allowed us to
                 reconstruct their evolutionary history. Contrary to other
                 neo-Y chromosomes, the fusion to X2 is quite ancient,
                 estimated at 48 Ma. Despite its old age and being even older
                 in the X1 homologous region which carries a huge inversion
                 that occurred as early as 55-48 Ma, genetic degeneration of
                 the neo-Y appears to be only moderate. Transcriptomic analysis
                 showed that sex chromosomes harbor 87 genes, which may serve
                 important functions in the testis. The accumulation of such
                 male-beneficial genes, a large inversion on the X1 homologous
                 region and fusion to X2 appear to be the main drivers of neo-Y
                 evolution in the spotted knifejaw. The availability of
                 high-quality assemblies of the neo-Y and both X chromosomes

                 genes, regardless of their expression, we sequenced male and
                 female genomes of S. latifolia and integrated the genomic

                 sex chromosome evolution. In the genus Silene, sex chromosomes

                 heteromorphic sex chromosomes have been detected. This section
                 might also exhibit lability in sex determination, because male
                 heterogamy and female heterogamy have been suggested to
                 occur.In this study, we investigated the sex determination

                 $\approx$160 million years ago in the ancestor of Iguania

                 The age of this system approximately coincides with the ages
                 of the avian and two mammalian sex chromosomes systems. To
                 compensate for the almost complete Y Chromosome degeneration,
                 X-linked genes have become twofold up-regulated, restoring

                 mammals originated from a pair of autosomes. Ohno hypothesised
                 nearly 50 years ago that the expression levels of X-linked
                 genes should be doubled to compensate for the degeneration of
                 their Y-linked homologues during sex chromosome evolution. The
                 advent of microarray and RNA (ribonucleic acid) sequencing
                 technologies in the past decade prompted a series of empirical
                 tests of Ohno's hypothesis. Surprisingly, X-chromosome dosage
                 compensation is found to be largely absent in mammals. Studies
                 of multiple independently evolved sex chromosome systems from
                 a variety of species revealed a large variation in
                 sex-chromosome dosage compensation, ranging from absence of
                 compensation to complete compensation, although further
                 scrutiny is required because of the high heterogeneities in
                 expression data acquisition and analysis methods among
                 studies. The lack of sex chromosome dosage compensation in at
                 least some lineages has important implications for
                 understanding gene expression evolution and sex chromosome
                 evolution. Key Concepts Ohno proposed that the expression
                 levels of mammalian X-linked genes should be doubled to
                 compensate for the degeneration of their Y-linked homologues
                 during sex chromosome evolution. Initial microarray studies of
                 genome-wide gene expression levels found an X : AA ratio of
                 ?1, consistent with Ohno's hypothesis. Subsequent analysis of
                 transcriptomic data generated by the more sensitive RNA
                 sequencing method found an X : AA ratio of ?0.5, inconsistent
                 with Ohno's hypothesis. Some argued that Ohno's hypothesis is
                 supported because X : AA is about 1 for actively expressed
                 genes, but this assertion is caused by a common
                 misunderstanding of Ohno's hypothesis. A direct comparison
                 between human X-linked genes and their one-to-one orthologues
                 located in chicken autosomes that are homologous to the
                 mammalian proto-X found no upregulation in mammalian X-linked
                 gene expression, refuting Ohno's hypothesis. A human proteomic
                 analysis found no evidence for a twofold upregulation of
                 protein concentrations of X-linked genes. Transcriptome
                 analyses of multiple species with independently evolved sex
                 chromosomes revealed a large variation in the presence/absence
                 and degree of sex chromosome dosage compensation, but further
                 scrutiny is required due to the high heterogeneities in the
                 data and methods used in the published studies. The lack of
                 sex chromosome dosage compensation in at least some lineages
                 suggests that halving the expression level of a gene usually
                 has no appreciable fitness consequences.",

                 mammalian sex chromosomes from a pair of autosomes, per-allele
                 expression levels of X-linked genes were doubled to compensate
                 for the degeneration of their Y homologs. This conjecture
                 forms the foundation of the current evolutionary model of sex
                 chromosome dosage compensation, but has been tested in mammals
                 only indirectly via a comparison of expression levels between
                 X-linked and autosomal genes in the same genome. The test
                 results have been controversial, because examinations of
                 different gene sets led to different conclusions that either
                 support or refute Ohno's hypothesis. Here we resolve this
                 uncertainty by directly comparing mammalian X-linked genes
                 with their one-to-one orthologs in species that diverged
                 before the origin of the mammalian sex chromosomes. Analyses

                 evidence for expression halving (i.e., no change in per-allele

                 evolution in plants. Previous work suggests that S. latifolia
                 XY chromosomes have gradually stopped recombining and the Y
                 chromosome is undergoing degeneration as in animal sex
                 chromosomes. However, this work has been limited by the
                 paucity of sex-linked genes available. Here, we used 35 Gb of
                 RNA-seq data from multiple males (XY) and females (XX) of an
                 S. latifolia inbred line to detect sex-linked SNPs and
                 identified more than 1,700 sex-linked contigs (with X-linked
                 and Y-linked alleles). Analyses using known sex-linked and
                 autosomal genes, together with simulations indicate that these
                 newly identified sex-linked contigs are reliable. Using read
                 numbers, we then estimated expression levels of X-linked and
                 Y-linked alleles in males and found an overall trend of
                 reduced expression of Y-linked alleles, consistent with a
                 widespread ongoing degeneration of the S. latifolia Y
                 chromosome. By comparing expression intensities of X-linked
                 alleles in males and females, we found that X-linked allele
                 expression increases as Y-linked allele expression decreases
                 in males, which makes expression of sex-linked contigs similar
                 in both sexes. This phenomenon is known as dosage compensation
                 and has so far only been observed in evolutionary old animal
                 sex chromosome systems. Our results suggest that dosage
                 compensation has evolved in plants and that it can quickly
                 evolve de novo after the origin of sex chromosomes.",

                 Females are XX and males XY, and any deviation generally leads
                 to infertility, mainly due to meiosis disruption. The African
                 pygmy mouse (Mus minutoides) presents an atypical sex
                 determination system with three sex chromosomes: the classical
                 X and Y chromosomes and a feminizing X chromosome variant,
                 called X*. Thus, three types of females coexist (XX, XX*, and
                 X*Y) that all show normal fertility. Moreover, the three
                 chromosomes (X and Y on one side and X* on the other side) are
                 fused to different autosomes, which results in the inclusion
                 of the sex chromosomes in a quadrivalent in XX* and X*Y
                 females at meiotic prophase. Here, we characterized the
                 configurations adopted by these sex chromosome quadrivalents
                 during meiotic prophase. The XX* quadrivalent displayed a
                 closed structure in which all homologous chromosome arms were
                 fully synapsed and with sufficient crossovers to ensure the
                 reductional segregation of all chromosomes at the first
                 meiotic division. Conversely, the X*Y quadrivalents adopted
                 either a closed configuration with non-homologous synapsis of
                 the X* and Y chromosomes or an open chain configuration in
                 which X* and Y remained asynapsed and possibly
                 transcriptionally silenced. Moreover, the number of crossovers
                 was insufficient to ensure chromosome segregation in a
                 significant fraction of nuclei. Together, these findings raise
                 questions about the mechanisms allowing X*Y females to have a

                 processes that shape genetic variation in natural populations.
                 In anisogamous species, these processes may generate
                 asymmetries between genes transmitted through sperm or eggs.
                 The unique inheritance of sex chromosomes facilitates studying
                 such asymmetries, but in many systems sex-biased mutation,
                 demography, and selection are confounded with suppressed
                 recombination in only one sex (the W in females, or the Y in
                 males). However, in a UV sex-determination system, both sex
                 chromosomes are sex-specific and experience suppressed
                 recombination. Here we built a spatially-structured simulation
                 to examine the effects of population density and sex-ratio on
                 female and male effective population size in haploids and
                 compare the results to polymorphism data from whole-genome
                 resequencing of the moss Ceratodon purpureus . In the
                 parameter space we simulated, males nearly always had a lower
                 effective population size than females. Using the C. purpureus
                 resequencing data, we found the U and V have lower nucleotide
                 diversity than the autosomal mean, and the V is much lower
                 than the U, however, we found no parameter set in the model
                 that explained both the U/V and U/autosome ratios we observed.
                 We next used standard molecular evolutionary analyses to test
                 for sex-biased mutation and selection. We found that males had
                 a higher mutation rate but that natural selection shapes
                 variation on the UV sex chromosomes. All together the moss
                 system highlights how anisogamy alone can exert a profound
                 influence on genome-wide patterns of molecular evolution.

                 always deleterious. Today, surveys of population genomic
                 diversity are revealing extensive loss-of-function and gene

                 profiling in male and female papayas to assess gene expression
                 patterns of sex-linked genes on the papaya sex chromosomes. By
                 analyzing expression ratios of sex-linked genes to autosomal
                 genes and sex-linked genes in males relative to females, our
                 results showed that dosage compensation was regulated on a

                 drivers of evolutionary divergence. Interlocus sexual conflict
                 is generally described as a conflict between alleles at two
                 interacting loci whose identity and genomic location are
                 arbitrary, but with opposite fitness effects in each sex. We
                 build on previous theory by suggesting that when loci under
                 interlocus sexual conflict are located on the sex chromosomes
                 it can lead to cycles of antagonistic coevolution between them
                 and therefore between the sexes. We tested this hypothesis by
                 performing experimental crosses using Drosophila melanogaster
                 where we reciprocally exchanged the sex chromosomes between
                 five allopatric wild-type populations in a round-robin design.
                 Disrupting putatively coevolved sex chromosome pairs resulted
                 in increased male reproductive success in 16 of 20
                 experimental populations (10 of which were individually
                 significant), but also resulted in lower offspring
                 egg-to-adult viability that affected both male and female
                 fitness. After 25 generations of experimental evolution these
                 sexually antagonistic fitness effects appeared to be resolved.
                 To formalize our hypothesis, we developed population genetic
                 models of antagonistic coevolution using fitness expressions
                 based on our empirical results. Our model predictions support
                 the conclusion that antagonistic coevolution between the sex
                 chromosomes is plausible under the fitness effects observed in
                 our experiments. Together, our results lend both empirical and
                 theoretical support to the idea that cycles of antagonistic
                 coevolution can occur between sex chromosomes and illustrate
                 how this process, in combination with autosomal coadaptation,

                 chromosomes. METHODS: We flow-sorted and separately sequenced
                 sex chromosomes and autosomes in R. acetosa using the
                 two-dimensional fluorescence in situ hybridization in
                 suspension (FISHIS) method and Illumina sequencing. We
                 identified and quantified individual repeats using
                 RepeatExplorer, Tandem Repeat Finder and the Tandem Repeats
                 Analysis Program. We employed fluorescence in situ
                 hybridization (FISH) to analyse the chromosomal localization
                 of satellites and transposons. KEY RESULTS: We identified a
                 number of novel satellites, which have, in a fashion similar
                 to previously known satellites, significantly expanded on the
                 Y chromosome but not as much on the X or on autosomes.
                 Additionally, the size increase of Y chromosomes is caused by
                 non-long terminal repeat (LTR) and LTR retrotransposons, while
                 only the latter contribute to the enlargement of the X
                 chromosome. However, the X chromosome is populated by
                 different LTR retrotransposon lineages than those on Y
                 chromosomes. CONCLUSIONS: The X and Y chromosomes have
                 significantly diverged in terms of repeat composition. The
                 lack of recombination probably contributed to the expansion of
                 diverse satellites and microsatellites and faster fixation of
                 newly inserted transposable elements (TEs) on the Y
                 chromosomes. In addition, the X and Y chromosomes, despite
                 similar total counts of TEs, differ significantly in the
                 representation of individual TE lineages, which indicates that
                 transposons proliferate preferentially in either the paternal
                 or the maternal lineage.",

                 iris, results from both pigments and structural coloration.
                 Avian iris colors exhibit striking interspecific and, in some
                 domestic species, intraspecific variations, suggesting unique
                 evolutionary and ecological histories. Here we tackled the
                 genetic basis of the pearl (white) iris color in domestic
                 pigeons ( Columba livia ), to elucidate the largely unknown
                 genetic mechanism underlying the evolution of avian iris
                 coloration. Using a genome-wide association study (GWAS) in 92
                 pigeons, we mapped the pearl iris trait to a 9 kb region and a
                 facilitative glucose transporter gene SLC2A11B . A nonsense
                 mutation W49X leading to a premature stop codon in SLC2A11B
                 was identified as the causal variant. Transcriptome analysis
                 suggested that SLC2A11B loss-of-function may downregulate the
                 xanthophore-differentiation gene CSF1R , and a key gene GCH1
                 involved in biosynthesis of pteridine, whose absence results
                 in pearl iris. Coalescence and phylogenetic analyses indicated
                 the mutation originated about 5,400 years ago coinciding with
                 the onset of pigeon domestication, while positive selection
                 was detected likely associated with artificial breeding.
                 Within Aves, potentially impaired SLC2A11B was found in 10
                 species from six distinct lineages correlated to their
                 signature brown or blue eyes. Analysis of vertebrate SLC2A11B
                 orthologs revealed relaxed selection in the avian clade,
                 consistent with the scenario that, during and after avian
                 divergence from reptile ancestor, the SLC2A11B-involved
                 development of dermal chromatophores likely degenerated due to
                 feather coverage. Our findings provide new insight into the
                 mechanism of avian iris color variations and the evolution of
                 pigmentation in vertebrates. \#\#\# Competing Interest

                 world has revolutionised our understanding of human history
                 and evolution. However, the general problem of how best to
                 characterise the full complexity of ancestral relationships
                 from the totality of human genomic variation remains unsolved.
                 Patterns of variation in each data set are typically analysed
                 independently, and often using parametric models or data
                 reduction techniques that cannot capture the full complexity
                 of human ancestry. Moreover, variation in sequencing
                 technology, data quality and in silico processing, coupled
                 with complexities of data scale, limit the ability to
                 integrate data sources. Here, we introduce a non-parametric
                 approach to inferring human genealogical history that
                 overcomes many of these challenges and enables us to build the
                 largest genealogy of both modern and ancient humans yet
                 constructed. The genealogy provides a lossless and compact
                 representation of multiple datasets, addresses the challenges
                 of missing and erroneous data, and benefits from using ancient
                 samples to constrain and date relationships. Using simulations
                 and empirical analyses, we demonstrate the power of the method
                 to recover relationships between individuals and populations,
                 as well as to identify descendants of ancient samples.
                 Finally, we show how applying a simple nonparametric estimator
                 of ancestor geographical location to the inferred genealogy
                 recapitulates key events in human history. Our results

                 features of genome architecture are largely conserved across
                 angiosperms. Parasitic plants have elucidated the many ways in
                 which genomes can be modified, yet we still lack comprehensive
                 genome data for species that represent the most extreme form
                 of parasitism. Here, we present the highly modified genome of
                 the iconic endophytic parasite Sapria himalayana Griff.
                 (Rafflesiaceae), which lacks a typical plant body. First, 44\%
                 of the genes conserved in eurosids are lost in Sapria,
                 dwarfing previously reported levels of gene loss in vascular
                 plants. These losses demonstrate remarkable functional
                 convergence with other parasitic plants, suggesting a common
                 genetic roadmap underlying the evolution of plant parasitism.
                 Second, we identified extreme disparity in intron size among
                 retained genes. This includes a category of genes with introns
                 longer than any so far observed in angiosperms, nearing 100 kb
                 in some cases, and a second category of genes with
                 exceptionally short or absent introns. Finally, at least 1.2\%
                 of the Sapria genome, including both genic and intergenic
                 content, is inferred to be derived from host-to-parasite
                 horizontal gene transfers (HGTs) and includes genes
                 potentially adaptive for parasitism. Focused phylogenomic
                 reconstruction of HGTs reveals a hidden history of former

                 (Crossoptilon mantchuricum) in China. We showed that C.

                 elements (TEs), and the establishment of
                 transcription-repressing heterochromatin during early
                 development safeguards genome integrity in Drosophila.
                 Repeat-rich Y chromosomes can act as reservoirs for TEs
                 ('toxic' Y effect), and incomplete epigenomic defenses during
                 early development can lead to deleterious TE mobilization.
                 Here, we contrast the dynamics of early TE activation in two
                 Drosophila species with vastly different Y chromosomes of
                 different ages. Zygotic TE expression is elevated in male
                 embryos relative to females in both species, mostly due to
                 expression of Y-linked TEs. Interestingly, male-biased TE
                 expression diminishes across development in D. pseudoobscura,
                 but remains elevated in D. miranda, the species with the
                 younger and larger Y chromosome. The repeat-rich Y of D.
                 miranda still contains many actively transcribed genes, which
                 compromise the formation of silencing heterochromatin.
                 Elevated TE expression results in more de novo insertions of
                 repeats in males compared to females. This lends support to
                 the idea that the 'toxic' Y chromosome can create a mutational
                 burden in males when genome-wide defense mechanisms are
                 compromised, and suggests a previously unappreciated
                 epigenetic conflict on evolving Y chromosomes between
                 transcription of essential genes and silencing of selfish DNA.",

                 different subgenera. Here, we sequence the small peritelomeric
                 X- and Y-linked regions of P. deltoides chromosome XIX. Two
                 genes are present only in the Y-linked region. One is a
                 duplication of a non-Y-linked, female-specifically expressed
                 response regulator, which produces siRNAs that block this
                 gene's expression, repressing femaleness. The other is an
                 LTR/Gypsy transposable element family member, which generates
                 long non-coding RNAs. Overexpression of this gene in A.

                 It has long been hypothesized that X-linked gene expression
                 levels have become doubled in males to restore the original
                 transcriptional output, and that the resulting X
                 overexpression in females then drove the evolution of X
                 inactivation (XCI). However, this model has never been
                 directly tested and patterns and mechanisms of dosage
                 compensation across different mammals and birds generally
                 remain little understood. Here we trace the evolution of
                 dosage compensation using extensive transcriptome data from
                 males and females representing all major mammalian lineages
                 and birds. Our analyses suggest that the X has become globally
                 upregulated in marsupials, whereas we do not detect a global
                 upregulation of this chromosome in placental mammals. However,
                 we find that a subset of autosomal genes interacting with
                 X-linked genes have become downregulated in placentals upon
                 the emergence of sex chromosomes. Thus, different driving
                 forces may underlie the evolution of XCI and the highly
                 efficient equilibration of X expression levels between the
                 sexes observed for both of these lineages. In the egg-laying
                 monotremes and birds, which have partially homologous sex
                 chromosome systems, partial upregulation of the X (Z in birds)
                 evolved but is largely restricted to the heterogametic sex,
                 which provides an explanation for the partially sex-biased X
                 (Z) expression and lack of global inactivation mechanisms in
                 these lineages. Our findings suggest that dosage reductions

                 consisting of six chromosomal arms (five large rods and a
                 small dot), but superficially similar karyotypes may conceal
                 the true extent of sex chromosome variation. Here, we use
                 whole-genome analysis in 37 fly species belonging to 22
                 different families of Diptera and uncover tremendous hidden
                 diversity in sex chromosome karyotypes among flies. We
                 identify over a dozen different sex chromosome configurations,
                 and the small dot chromosome is repeatedly used as the sex
                 chromosome, which presumably reflects the ancestral karyotype
                 of higher Diptera. However, we identify species with
                 undifferentiated sex chromosomes, others in which a different
                 chromosome replaced the dot as a sex chromosome or in which up
                 to three chromosomal elements became incorporated into the sex
                 chromosomes, and others yet with female heterogamety (ZW sex
                 chromosomes). Transcriptome analysis shows that dosage
                 compensation has evolved multiple times in flies, consistently
                 through up-regulation of the single X in males. However, X
                 chromosomes generally show a deficiency of genes with
                 male-biased expression, possibly reflecting sex-specific
                 selective pressures. These species thus provide a rich
                 resource to study sex chromosome biology in a comparative

  abstract    = "A model for the evolution of gynodioecy from the hermaphrodite
                 or monoecious condition is described, taking into account the
                 effects of partial selfing and inbreeding depression. It is
                 shown that a mutant causing male-sterility can be selected
                 even if the female plants have the same ovule output as the
                 hermaphrodites, but that the conditions for this are very
                 stringent: The product of the selfing rate and the inbreeding
                 depression must exceed one-half. If the females have an
                 increased ovule output, gynodioecy can evolve with lower
                 values of the selfing and inbreeding depression parameters.
                 Expressions for the equilibrium frequency of females and of
                 the male-sterility gene in both the dominant and the recessive
                 case are given. By a similar technique, conditions for the
                 evolution of androdioecy are derived. In a selfing population,
                 these conditions are much less easily satisfied than those for
                 gynodioecy, though in a randomly mating population the
                 conditions are similar: If ovule production is abolished,
                 pollen production must be more than doubled, or vice versa.
                 Since androdioecy is known to be a very rare condition, it
                 seems likely that avoidance of selfing has played a role in
                 the evolution of gynodioecy. Using the equilibria derived for
                 gynodioecy, the conditions for the evolution of subdioecy or
                 dioecy, by means of a partial or total female-sterility
                 mutation, are studied. In contrast to the situation in a
                 hermaphrodite population, a female-sterility gene can be
                 selected in a gynodioecious population if it confers a
                 moderate increase in pollen output; some increase in pollen
                 output is essential. The fate of such a female-sterility gene
                 also depends on its linkage with the male-sterility gene. If
                 this is recessive, and the female-sterility gene is dominant
                 and has an effect in the females as well as the hermaphrodite
                 individuals, then the second mutation will usually be
                 eliminated unless it occurs at a locus tightly linked to the
                 first gene. In other cases there is no such ``linkage
                 constraint,'' though in all situations there may be selection
                 for tighter linkage between the loci; this will result in an
                 initially subdioecious population becoming more fully
                 dioecious. These results agree with some of the facts known
                 about the evolution of dioecy in plants. First, since
                 gynodioecy is more often controlled by a recessive than a
                 dominant gene, male heterogamety should be commoner than
                 female, as is observed. Second, subdioecy should be common,
                 since full dioecy requires not only the correct phenotypic
                 effects of the two genes but also complementary dominance
                 relations and tight linkage; subdioecy is indeed known in many
                 species. The equilibria reached by our model have only one
                 type of female in appreciable frequency, whereas the
                 polleniferous individuals may fall into several genotypic
                 classes; it is often observed that in subdioecious species the
                 males are more variable than the females, regardless of which
                 is the heterogametic sex. Finally, the equilibria generated by
                 our model agree closely with the results of genetical studies
                 of those dioecious species with male-determining Y chromosomes
                 that have been investigated, in which both male-and
                 female-sterility factors have been found, showing
                 complementary dominance relations and no crossing-over between
                 the loci, so that just two gamete types exist. Such a
                 situation can be explained by the operation of the linkage
                 constraint, which ensures that only linked mutations become
                 established and does not require that unlinked genes have been
                 brought together. This is consistent with the fact that
                 dioecious species often have the same chromosome numbers as
                 their bisexual relatives.",

                 incredible diversity of sex chromosome systems, making it
                 possible to empirically test the rich body of evolutionary
                 theory that describes each stage of sex chromosome evolution.
                 Classic theory predicts that sex chromosomes originate from a
                 pair of homologous autosomes and recombination between them is
                 suppressed via inversions to resolve sexual conflict. The
                 resulting degradation of the Y chromosome gene content creates
                 the need for dosage compensation in the heterogametic sex. Sex
                 chromosome theory also implies a linear process, starting from
                 sex chromosome origin and progressing to heteromorphism.
                 Despite many convergent genomic patterns exhibited by
                 independently evolved sex chromosome systems, and many case
                 studies supporting these theoretical predictions, emerging
                 data provide numerous interesting exceptions to these
                 long-standing theories, and suggest that the remarkable
                 diversity of sex chromosomes is matched by a similar diversity
                 in their evolution. For example, it is clear that sex
                 chromosome pairs are not always derived from homologous
                 autosomes. In addition, both the cause and the mechanism of
                 recombination suppression between sex chromosome pairs remain
                 unclear, and it may be that the spread of recombination
                 suppression is a more gradual process than previously thought.
                 It is also clear that dosage compensation can be achieved in
                 many ways, and displays a range of efficacy in different
                 systems. Finally, the remarkable turnover of sex chromosomes
                 in many systems, as well as variation in the rate of sex
                 chromosome divergence, suggest that assumptions about the
                 inevitable linearity of sex chromosome evolution are not
                 always empirically supported, and the drivers of the
                 birth-death cycle of sex chromosome evolution remain to be
                 elucidated. Here, we concentrate on how the diversity in sex

                 testable hypotheses for the ultimate (evolutionary) and
                 proximate (mechanistic) causes for such expansions of
                 recombination suppression, including i) antagonistic
                 selection, ii) association of additional functions to
                 mating-type, such as uniparental mitochondria inheritance,
                 iii) accumulation in the margin of non-recombining regions of
                 various factors, including deleterious mutations or
                 transposable elements due to relaxed selection, or neutral
                 rearrangements due to genetic drift. The study of

                 wild-type alleles, a ubiquitous phenomenon whose nature has
                 been a subject of a long debate. We measured gene expression
                 in two isogenic Drosophila lines heterozygous for long
                 deletions and compared our results with previously published
                 gene expression data in a line heterozygous for a long
                 duplication. We find that a majority of genes are at least
                 partially compensated at transcription, both for (1/2)-fold
                 dosage (in heterozygotes for deletions) and for 1.5-fold
                 dosage (in heterozygotes for a duplication). The degree of
                 compensation does not vary among functional classes of genes.
                 Compensation for deletions is stronger for highly expressed
                 genes. In contrast, the degree of compensation for
                 duplications is stronger for weakly expressed genes. Thus,
                 partial transcriptional compensation appears to be based on
                 regulatory mechanisms that insure high transcription levels of
                 some genes and low transcription levels of other genes,
                 instead of precise maintenance of a particular homeostatic
                 expression level. Given the ubiquity of transcriptional
                 compensation, dominance of wild-type alleles may be at least

                 Current theory proposes that this degeneration follows the
                 arrest of recombination and results from the accumulation of
                 deleterious mutations due to selective interference-the
                 inefficacy of natural selection on non-recombining genomic
                 regions. This theory requires very few assumptions, but it
                 does not robustly predict fast erosion of the Y (or W) in
                 large populations or the stepwise degeneration of several
                 small non-recombining strata. We propose a new mechanism for
                 Y/W erosion that works over faster timescales, in large
                 populations, and for small non-recombining regions (down to a
                 single sex-linked gene). The mechanism is based on the
                 instability and divergence of cis-regulatory sequences in
                 non-recombining genome regions, which become selectively
                 haploidized to mask deleterious mutations on coding sequences.
                 This haploidization is asymmetric, because cis-regulators on
                 the X cannot be silenced (otherwise there would be no
                 expression in females). This process causes rapid Y/W
                 degeneration and simultaneous evolution of dosage
                 compensation, provided that autosomal trans-regulatory
                 sequences with sex-limited effects are available to compensate
                 for cis-regulatory divergence. Although this ``degeneration by
                 regulatory evolution'' does not require selective
                 interference, both processes may act in concert to further
                 accelerate Y degeneration.",

                 of life and exhibit broad taxonomic patterns that remain a
                 puzzle, such as males living longer than females in birds and
                 vice versa in mammals. The prevailing ``unguarded-X''
                 hypothesis (UXh) explains this by differential expression of
                 recessive mutations in the X/Z chromosome of the heterogametic
                 sex (e.g., females in birds and males in mammals), but has
                 only received indirect support to date. An alternative
                 hypothesis is that the accumulation of deleterious mutations
                 and repetitive elements on the Y/W chromosome might lower the
                 survival of the heterogametic sex (``toxic Y'' hypothesis).
                 Here, we report lower survival of the heterogametic relative
                 to the homogametic sex across 138 species of birds, mammals,
                 reptiles and amphibians, as expected if sex chromosomes shape
                 sex-specific lifespans. We then analysed bird and mammal
                 karyotypes and found that the relative sizes of the X and Z
                 chromosomes are not associated with sex-specific lifespans,
                 contrary to UXh predictions. In contrast, we found that Y size
                 correlates negatively with male survival in mammals, where
                 toxic Y effects are expected to be particularly strong. This
                 suggests that small Y chromosomes benefit male lifespans. Our
                 results confirm the role of sex chromosomes in explaining sex
                 differences in lifespan, but indicate that, at least in
                 mammals, this is better explained by ``toxic Y'' rather than

                 while in birds, males tend to live longer than females. One
                 possible explanation for these differences in lifespan is the
                 unguarded X hypothesis, which suggests that the reduced or
                 absent chromosome in the heterogametic sex (e.g. the Y
                 chromosome in mammals and the W chromosome in birds) exposes
                 recessive deleterious mutations on the other sex chromosome.
                 While the unguarded X hypothesis is intuitively appealing, it
                 had never been subject to a broad test. We compiled male and
                 female longevity data for 229 species spanning 99 families, 38
                 orders and eight classes across the tree of life. Consistent
                 with the unguarded X hypothesis, a meta-analysis showed that
                 the homogametic sex, on average, lives 17.6\% longer than the

  abstract    = "Heterochromatin suppresses repetitive DNA, and a loss of
                 heterochromatin has been observed in aged cells of several
                 species, including humans and Drosophila. Males often contain
                 substantially more heterochromatic DNA than females, due to
                 the presence of a large, repeat-rich Y chromosome, and male
                 flies generally have a shorter average lifespan than females.
                 Here we show that repetitive DNA becomes de-repressed more
                 rapidly in old male flies relative to females, and repeats on
                 the Y chromosome are disproportionally mis-expressed during
                 ageing. This is associated with a loss of heterochromatin at
                 repetitive elements during ageing in male flies, and a general
                 loss of repressive chromatin in aged males away from
                 pericentromeric regions and the Y. By generating flies with
                 different sex chromosome karyotypes (XXY females and X0 and
                 XYY males), we show that repeat de-repression and average
                 lifespan is correlated with the number of Y chromosomes. This
                 suggests that sex-specific chromatin differences may

                 perform a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of sexual
                 antagonism. We identify approximately 230 chromosomal clusters
                 of candidate antagonistic single nucleotide polymorphisms

                 Recently, we have seen several advancements from studies on
                 green algae, brown algae, and land plants that are providing a
                 broader understanding of the variable ways in which sex
                 chromosomes can evolve in distant eukaryotic groups. Plant
                 sex-determining genes are being identified and, as expected,
                 are completely different from those in animals. Species with
                 varying levels of differentiation between the X and Y have
                 been found in plants, and these are hypothesized to be
                 representing different stages of sex chromosome evolution.
                 However, we are also finding that sex chromosomes can remain
                 morphologically unchanged over extended periods of time. Where
                 degeneration of the Y occurs, it appears to proceed similarly
                 in plants and animals. Dosage compensation (a phenomenon that
                 compensates for the consequent loss of expression from the Y)
                 has now been documented in a plant system, its mechanism,
                 however, remains unknown. Research has also begun on the role
                 of sex chromosomes in sexual conflict resolution, and it
                 appears that sex-biased genes evolve similarly in plants and
                 animals, although the functions of these genes remain poorly
                 studied. Because the difficulty in obtaining sex chromosome
                 sequences is increasingly being overcome by methodological
                 developments, there is great potential for further discovery

                 the study of sex chromosome evolution, as genetic sex
                 determination has evolved repeatedly and is often absent in
                 close relatives. I review sex-determining regions in non-model
                 plant species, which may help us to understand when and how
                 (and, potentially, test hypotheses about why) recombination
                 suppression evolves within young sex chromosomes. I emphasize
                 high-throughput sequencing approaches that are increasingly
                 being applied to plants to test for non-recombining regions.
                 These data are particularly illuminating when combined with
                 sequence data that allow phylogenetic analyses, and estimates
                 of when these regions evolved. Together with comparative

                 in behavior, morphology, and physiology. These differences
                 raise many questions regarding how such divergent phenotypes
                 can arise from a genome that is largely shared between the
                 sexes. Recent progress in genomics has revealed some of the
                 actual genetic mechanisms that create separate sex-specific
                 phenotypes, and the evidence indicates that thousands of genes
                 across all portions of the genome contribute to male and
                 female forms through sex-biased gene expression. Related work

                 polymerase IV (Pol IV) is required for the formation of
                 transposable element (TE)-derived small RNA (sRNA)
                 transcripts. These transcripts are processed by DICER-LIKE 3
                 into 24-nt small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) that guide
                 RNA-dependent DNA methylation. In the pollen grain, Pol IV is
                 also required for the accumulation of 21/22-nt
                 epigenetically-activated siRNAs (easiRNAs) that likely silence
                 TEs by post-transcriptional mechanisms. Despite this proposed
                 functional role, loss of Pol IV function in Arabidopsis does
                 not cause a discernable pollen defect. Here, we show that loss
                 of NRPD1, encoding the largest subunit of Pol IV in the
                 Brassicaceae Capsella rubella, causes post-meiotic arrest of
                 pollen development at the microspore stage. As in Arabidopsis,
                 all TE-derived siRNAs were depleted in Capsella nrpd1
                 microspores. In wild-type background, we found that the same
                 TEs produced 21/22-nt and 24-nt siRNAs, leading us to propose
                 that Pol IV is generating the direct precursors for 21-24-nt
                 siRNAs, which are targeted by different DICERs. Arrest of
                 Capsella nrpd1 microspores was accompanied by deregulation of
                 genes targeted by Pol IV-dependent siRNAs. The distance of TEs
                 to genes was much closer in Capsella rubella compared to
                 Arabidopsis thaliana, providing a possible explanation for the
                 essential role of Pol IV for pollen development in Capsella.

                 driven by sexually antagonistic selection in the diploid
                 phase. However, selection during the haploid gametic phase of
                 the lifecycle has recently received theoretical attention as
                 possibly playing a central role in sex chromosome evolution,
                 especially in plants where gene expression in the haploid
                 phase is extensive. In particular, male-specific haploid
                 selection might favor the linkage of pollen beneficial alleles
                 to male sex determining regions on incipient Y chromosomes.
                 This linkage might then allow such alleles to further
                 specialize for the haploid phase. Purifying haploid selection
                 is also expected to slow the degeneration of Y-linked genes
                 expressed in the haploid phase. Here, we examine the evolution
                 of gene expression in flower buds and pollen of two species of
                 Rumex to test for signatures of haploid selection acting
                 during plant sex chromosome evolution. We find that genes with
                 high ancestral pollen expression bias occur more often on sex
                 chromosomes than autosomes and that genes on the Y chromosome
                 are more likely to become enriched for pollen expression bias.
                 We also find that genes with low expression in pollen are more
                 likely to be lost from the Y chromosome. Our results suggest
                 that sex-specific haploid selection during the gametophytic
                 stage of the lifecycle may be a major contributor to several

                 American species and subspecies of Silene virginica and S.

                 identified large autosomal genomic regions with chromosomal

                 supporting a role of rearrangements in preventing gene flow in

                 Unexpectedly, the non-recombining mating-type chromosomes

                 non-recombining may explain such patterns that oppose to those
                 found for XY or ZW sex chromosomes. The specific features of

                 and diploids. As sex chromosomes differentiate, reduced
                 recombination becomes favored between selected loci and the
                 sex-determining region, strengthening genetic associations
                 between alleles favored in a sex and the corresponding sex
                 chromosome. Here a model is analyzed to explore whether
                 polymorphism at one sexually or ploidally antagonistic locus
                 facilitates the spread of rare alleles at other loci
                 experiencing antagonistic selection, promoting further
                 differentiation of the sex chromosomes. It is found that
                 antagonistic polymorphisms can spread and capture other such
                 loci, building 'genomic islands' of differentiation on sex

                 requiring the loci to be strongly selected, tightly linked and

                 nonrecombining region for a longer period than R. hastatulus,
                 consistent with this system being at a more advanced stage of
                 degeneration. Intra- and interspecific comparisons of genomic
                 coverage and heterozygosity indicated that loss of expression
                 precedes gene deletion, implying that the final stages of
                 mutation accumulation and gene loss may often occur neutrally.
                 We found no evidence for adaptive silencing of genes that have
                 lost expression. Our results suggest that the initial spread

                 many species, and a common feature of their evolution is the
                 degeneration of the Y chromosome, characterized by a loss of
                 gene content and function. Despite being of broad significance
                 to our understanding of sex chromosome evolution, the genetic
                 changes that occur during the early stages of Y-chromosome
                 degeneration are poorly understood, especially in plants.
                 Here, we investigate sex chromosome evolution in the dioecious
                 plant Rumex hastatulus, in which X and Y chromosomes have
                 evolved relatively recently and occur in two distinct systems:
                 an ancestral XX/XY system and a derived XX/XY1Y2 system. This
                 polymorphism provides a unique opportunity to investigate the
                 effect of sex chromosome age on patterns of divergence and
                 gene degeneration within a species. Despite recent suppression
                 of recombination and low X-Y divergence in both systems, we
                 find evidence that Y-linked genes have started to undergo gene
                 loss, causing ∼28\% and ∼8\% hemizygosity of the ancestral and
                 derived X chromosomes, respectively. Furthermore, genes
                 remaining on Y chromosomes have accumulated more amino acid
                 replacements, contain more unpreferred changes in codon use,
                 and exhibit significantly reduced gene expression compared
                 with their X-linked alleles, with the magnitude of these
                 effects being greatest for older sex-linked genes. Our results
                 provide evidence for reduced selection efficiency and ongoing
                 Y-chromosome degeneration in a flowering plant, and indicate
                 that Y degeneration can occur soon after recombination

                 the advent of new sequencing technologies, the evolution of
                 gene expression is becoming a subject of intensive genomic
                 research, with sparking debates upon the role played by these
                 kinds of changes in adaptive evolution and speciation. In this
                 article, we model expression evolution in species differing by
                 their reproductive systems. We consider different rates of
                 sexual versus asexual reproduction and the different type of
                 parthenogenesis (apomixis and the various modes of automixis).
                 We show that competition for expression leads to two selective
                 processes on cis-regulatory regions that act independently to
                 organism-level adaptation. Coevolution within regulatory
                 networks allows these processes to occur without strongly
                 modifying expression levels. First, cis-regulatory regions
                 such as enhancers evolve in a runaway fashion because they
                 automatically become associated to chromosomes purged from
                 deleterious mutations (``Enhancer Runaway process''). Second,
                 in clonal or nearly clonal species, homologous cis-regulatory
                 regions tend to diverge, which leads to haploidization of
                 expression, when they are sufficiently isolated from one
                 another (``Enhancer Divergence process''). We show how these
                 two processes cooccur and vary depending on the level of
                 outcrossing, gene conversion, mitotic recombination, or
                 recombination in automictic species. This study offers thus a
                 baseline to understand patterns of expression evolution across
                 the diversity of eukaryotic species.",

                 rates of recombination, and exposure to natural selection, all
                 of which can affect patterns of genetic diversity. On Y
                 chromosomes with suppressed recombination, natural selection
                 is expected to eliminate linked neutral variation, and lower
                 the Ne of Y compared to X chromosomes or autosomes. However,
                 female-biased sex ratios and high variance in male
                 reproductive success can also reduce Y-linked Ne , making it
                 difficult to infer the causes of low Y-diversity. Here, we
                 investigate the factors affecting levels of polymorphism
                 during sex chromosome evolution in the dioecious plant
                 Rumexhastatulus (Polygonaceae). Strikingly, we find that
                 neutral diversity for genes on the Y chromosome is, on
                 average, 2.1\% of the value for their X-linked homologs,
                 corresponding to a chromosome-wide reduction of 93\% compared
                 to the standard neutral expectation. We demonstrate that the
                 magnitude of this diversity loss is inconsistent with reduced
                 male Ne caused by neutral processes. Instead, using forward
                 simulations and estimates of the distribution of deleterious
                 fitness effects, we show that Y chromosome diversity loss can
                 be explained by purifying selection acting in aggregate over a
                 large number of genetically linked sites. Simulations also
                 suggest that our observed level of Y-diversity is consistent
                 with the joint action of purifying and positive selection, but
                 only for models in which there were fewer constrained sites
                 than we empirically estimated. Given the relatively recent
                 origin of R. hastatulus sex chromosomes, our results imply
                 that Y-chromosome degeneration in the early stages may be
                 largely driven by selective interference rather than by
                 neutral genetic drift of silenced Y-linked genes.",

  abstract    = "Contemporary effective population size (N e) can be estimated
                 using linkage disequilibrium (LD) observed across pairs of
                 loci presumed to be selectively neutral and unlinked. This
                 method has been commonly applied to data sets containing
                 10--100 loci to inform conservation and study population
                 demography. Performance of these N e estimates could be
                 improved by incorporating data from thousands of loci.
                 However, these thousands of loci exist on a limited number of
                 chromosomes, ensuring that some fraction will be physically
                 linked. Linked loci have elevated LD due to limited
                 recombination, which if not accounted for can cause N e
                 estimates to be downwardly biased. Here, we present results
                 from coalescent and forward simulations designed to evaluate
                 the bias of LD-based N e estimates (^ N e). Contrary to common
                 perceptions, increasing the number of loci does not increase
                 the magnitude of linkage. Although we show it is possible to
                 identify some pairs of loci that produce unusually large r 2
                 values, simply removing large r 2 values is not a reliable way
                 to eliminate bias. Fortunately, the magnitude of bias in ^ N e
                 is strongly and negatively correlated with the process of
                 recombination, including the number of chromosomes and their
                 length, and this relationship provides a general way to adjust
                 for bias. Additionally, we show that with thousands of loci,
                 precision of ^ N e is much lower than expected based on the
                 assumption that each pair of loci provides completely
                 independent information. Heredity (2016) 117, 233--240;

                 INTRODUCTION Effective population size (N e) is a fundamental
                 population genetics concept (Wright, 1931), which determines
                 the rate of evolutionary change due to genetic drift and
                 informs the equilibrium level of genetic variation and the
                 effectiveness of selection. N e is often much lower than
                 census size (Frankham, 1995), demonstrating that simply
                 counting individuals is insufficient to predict rates of
                 evolutionary change. In addition to the number of mating
                 individuals, N e is affected by sex ratio, variation in
                 reproductive success, age structure, migration and other
                 demographic factors. It is an extremely relevant metric in
                 conservation biology, with low N e leading to inbreeding and
                 reduced genetic diversity (Ellstrand and Elam, 1993). See
                 Charlesworth (2009) for a primer on N e , and Wang (2005) for
                 a review of estimation methods. Populations with smaller N e
                 undergo more genetic drift than larger populations. This
                 genetic drift randomly generates associations between alleles
                 at different loci, known as linkage (or gametic)
                 disequilibrium (LD) at a rate inversely proportional to N e .
                 As a result, measures of LD between independently-segregating
                 loci can be used to provide an estimate of N e (Sved, 1971;
                 Hill, 1981; Waples, 1991). Over the past decades, many studies
                 have leveraged data sets consisting of a few dozen loci for
                 genetic estimates of N e (Luikart et al., 2010). While these
                 studies continue to be useful, especially for long-running
                 projects, biologists now have access to genomic methods that
                 generate orders of magnitude more data. These technologies are
                 growing quickly and have made it feasible to genotype many
                 thousands of loci and improve inference of demographic
                 parameters, provided that the scale and particularities of
                 these new data sets are managed well. Here, we examine the
                 benefits of applying the LD method to estimate contemporary N
                 e with high-throughput genomic data, and address implications
                 for both bias and precision. To estimate contemporary N e with
                 the LD method, it is necessary to measure LD between loci that
                 are inherited independently (that is, recombination fraction
                 (c) equal to 0.5). Estimates of past N e are available by
                 measuring LD between physically-linked loci with recombination
                 fraction less than 0.5 (Hill, 1981); however, recombi-nation
                 fractions must be known with high precision to look more than
                 a few generations in the past. Recombination fractions are
                 rarely known for non-model species, so this effectively limits
                 their applica-tion to model species (for example, Tenesa et
                 al., 2007; Hollenbeck et al., 2016). For non-model species, a

              These changes include massive gene loss, rampant tandem
              duplications and multiple horizontal gene transfers from
              bacteria, contributing to the diversification of defence-related
              gene families. The insertion of transposable elements into
              introns has led to the large size of the Ceratopteris genome and
              to exceptionally long genes relative to other plants. Gene family

              Strong recombination landscape dimorphism between the sexes could
              have important implications for the dynamics of sex chromosome
              evolution because low recombination in the heterogametic sex can
              favour the spread of sexually antagonistic alleles. Here, we
              present a sex-specific linkage map and revised genome assembly of
              Rumex hastatulus and provide the first evidence and
              characterization of sex differences in recombination landscape in
              a dioecious plant. We present data on significant sex differences
              in recombination, with regions of very low recombination in males
              covering over half of the genome. This pattern is evident on both
              sex chromosomes and autosomes, suggesting that pre-existing

              chromosome formation and divergence. Our analysis of segregation

              spread of the Paris drivers in natural populations has elicited
              the selection of drive resistant Y chromosomes. To infer the
              evolutionary history of the Y chromosome in relation to the Paris

              from a different location. Among them, 13 lines carry a Y
              chromosome that is able to counteract the effect of the drivers.
              Despite their very different geographical origins, all sensitive
              Y's are highly similar, suggesting that they share a recent
              common ancestor. The resistant Y chromosomes are more divergent

              complex genetic basis. In addition, XY chromosome conflict has
              resulted in rapid expansions of ampliconic genes with
              dosage-dependent expression that is essential to spermatogenesis.
              Here, we evaluated the contribution of XY lineage mismatch to
              male fertility and stage-specific gene expression in hybrid mice.
              We performed backcrosses between two house mouse subspecies to
              generate reciprocal Y-introgression strains and used these
              strains to test the effects of XY mismatch in hybrids. Our

                 inefficient selection due to loss of recombination, or whether
                 adaptive gene silencing on the Y chromosome results in most
                 degeneration occurring neutrally. We used comparative
                 transcriptome data from two related annual plants with highly
                 heteromorphic sex chromosomes, Rumex rothschildianus and Rumex

                 importance of these evolutionary forces may differ in species
                 with different effective population sizes. Here, we survey
                 population genetic variation at 105 orthologous X-linked
                 protein coding regions in Drosophila melanogaster and its
                 sister species D. simulans, two closely related species with
                 distinct demographic histories. We observe significantly
                 higher levels of polymorphism and evidence for stronger

                 a larger historical effective population size on average for

                 <10\% of newly arising nonsynonymous mutations have
                 deleterious fitness effects in the nearly neutral range (i.e.,

                 tandem with the divergence of sex chromosomes to prevent the
                 deleterious effects of dosage imbalances that occur as a
                 result of sex chromosome divergence. Examples of complete
                 dosage compensation, where gene expression of the entire sex
                 chromosome is compensated, are rare, and have only been found
                 in relatively ancient sex chromosome systems. Consequently,
                 very little is known about the evolutionary dynamics of
                 complete dosage compensation systems. Within the family
                 Poeciliidae the subgenus Lebistes share the same sex
                 chromosome system which originated 18.48-26.08 Ma. In Poecilia
                 reticulata and P. wingei, the Y chromosome has been largely
                 maintained, whereas the Y in the closely related species P.

                 picta to be the first example of complete dosage compensation

                 dosage compensation, thus complete dosage compensation likely
                 evolved in the short (∼3.7 Myr) interval after the split of
                 the ancestor of these two species from P. reticulata, but
                 before they diverged from each other. These data suggest that
                 novel dosage compensation mechanisms can evolve rapidly, thus
                 supporting the longstanding theoretical prediction that such

  author      = "Bachtrog, Doris",
  abstract    = "BACKGROUND: Gene-poor, degenerate Y chromosomes have evolved
                 repeatedly from ordinary autosomes, but little is known about
                 the processes that silence most genes on an evolving Y.
                 RESULTS: Here, I quantify relative expression levels of 58
                 gene pairs on the recently formed neo-sex chromosomes of
                 Drosophila miranda, in order to test competing models of gene
                 inactivation on its newly evolving Y chromosome (the neo-Y).
                 Although the neo-Y of D. miranda still contains the majority
                 of its original genes, most exhibit an accelerated rate of
                 protein evolution, and many contain frameshift or nonsense
                 mutations. All but three of these genes show significantly
                 different levels of expression from the neo-X and neo-Y
                 chromosome, with approximately 80\% of all genes being
                 expressed at lower levels from the neo-Y. The downregulation
                 of many genes on the neo-Y appears to occur randomly,
                 regardless of the level of accumulation of amino acid
                 substitutions or whether the gene produces a functional
                 protein. In addition, adjacent genes show considerable
                 heterogeneity in levels of gene expression, an observation
                 that argues against chromatin-structure-mediated changes in
                 gene expression levels. CONCLUSIONS: My results suggest that
                 transcriptional inactivation of degenerating Y linked genes is
                 an accidental by-product of mutation accumulation, and not
                 driven by selection to either maintain expression at
                 functional loci or downregulate maladapted genes from the
                 neo-Y. Thus, most mutations observed on the neo-Y are likely
                 to have deleterious effects on fitness and accumulate as a
                 result of the reduced efficiency of natural selection on a
                 nonrecombining chromosome, rather than neutrally or

  abstract = "Y and W chromosomes often stop recombining and degenerate.
              Different theories have been proposed to explain these
              observations. The classic theory supposes that recombination
              arrest is favored because it allows to permanently link
              sex-antagonistic alleles to the sex in which they are favorable.
              The regulatory theory supposes that recombination arrest is
              initially caused by lucky inversions on the Y or W carrying fewer
              deleterious mutations than average, which then become selectively
              stabilized by the evolution of nascent dosage compensation
              creating sex-antagonistic regulatory effects. Last, the shelter
              theory also supposes that lucky Y (or W) inversions do occur, but
              that they are maintained in the long term because of a lack of
              genetic variation to restore recombination. The last two theories
              are comparable in the sense that they do not require sexually
              dimorphic traits, and are based primarily on the flux of
              deleterious mutations. In this paper, we focus on the shelter
              theory and show that contrarily to previous claims, it can hardly
              explain the evolution of sex chromosomes. We show that it is not
              robust to extremely low rates of recombination restoration, that
              it would cause population extinction rather than Y degeneration,
              and that it is orders of magnitudes less efficient than the
              mechanism described in the regulatory theory. We also argue that
              the assumption of a lack of genetic variation to restore
              recombination is unplausible given known mechanisms of
              recombination variation, and given the extremely small rates of
              restoration that are sufficient to make the shelter theory

                 provides improved support for monophyly of this clade (based
                 on inclusion of further dioecious species) and a new estimate
                 of its age (ca 2.3 million years). We observed a rise in
                 adaptive evolution in the autosomal and pseudoautosomal parts
                 of the genome on the branch where dioecy originated. This
                 increase is not a result of the accumulation of sexually
                 antagonistic genes in the pseudoautosomal region. It is also
                 not caused by the coevolution of genes acting in mitochondria

                 drivers of reproductive isolation , empirical population
                 genetics has mostly examined species with heteromorphic sex
                 chromosomes. We recently reported restricted in-trogression at
                 sex-linked markers in an amphibian system with ho-momorphic
                 sex chromosomes (Hyla), consistent with a large X-effect,
                 designating a greater role of sex chromosomes in driving
                 hybrid incompatibilities. Here, using a similar approach, we
                 examined two hybrid zones of Palearctic green toads (Bufo
                 viridis subgroup), involving several lineages that arose at
                 different times and form secondary contacts. We find no
                 evidence for differential introgression of sex-linked versus
                 autosomal markers across both zones. This absence of large
                 X-effects in Bufo indicates that, unlike in Hyla, hybrid
                 incompatibilities may not result from the faster-heterogametic
                 sex and faster-male aspects of Haldane's rule. The recent
                 suppression of XY recombination in Hyla but not in Bufo may
                 have driven greater divergence between Hyla sex chromosomes,
                 causing stronger reproductive isolation. Alternatively ,
                 stronger linkage among Hyla's sex-linked markers could
                 restrict introgression. We hypothesize that the degree of
                 sex-specific recombination may condition the importance of
                 homomorphic sex chromosomes in speciation.",

                 evolutionary fate of the repetitive sequences in the Y
                 chromosome. Here we compare the evolutionary pathways leading
                 to the appearance of three different families of satellite-DNA
                 sequences within the genomes of Rumex acetosa and R.
                 papillaris, two dioecious plant species with a complex
                 XX/XY1Y2 sex-chromosome system. We have found that two of
                 these families, one autosomic (the RAE730 family) and one
                 Y-linked (the RAYSI family), arose independently from the
                 ancestral duplication of the same 120-bp repeat unit.
                 Conversely, a comparative analysis of the three satellite-DNA
                 families reveals no evolutionary relationships between these
                 two and the third, RAE180, also located in the Y chromosomes.
                 However, we have demonstrated that, regardless of the

                 sequences have different evolutionary fates according to their
                 location in different types of chromosomes. Specifically,
                 those in the Y chromosomes have evolved at half the rate of

                 found that a large block containing overlapping inversions on

                 Female hybrids showed significant D. albomicans--biased

  abstract = "In recent years it became clear that in eukaryotic genome
              evolution gene loss is prevalent over gene gain. However, the
              absence of genes in an annotated genome is not always equivalent
              to the loss of genes. Due to sequencing issues, or incorrect gene
              prediction, genes can be falsely inferred as absent. This implies
              that loss estimates are overestimated and, more generally, that
              falsely inferred absences impact genomic comparative studies.
              However, reliable estimates of how prevalent this issue is are
              lacking. Here we quantified the impact of gene prediction on gene
              loss estimates in eukaryotes by analysing 209 phylogenetically
              diverse eukaryotic organisms and comparing their predicted
              proteomes to that of their respective six-frame translated
              genomes. We observe that 4.61\% of domains per species were
              falsely inferred to be absent for Pfam domains predicted to have
              been present in the last eukaryotic common ancestor. Between
              phylogenetically different categories this estimate varies
              substantially: for clade-specific loss (ancestral loss) we found
              1.30\% and for species-specific loss 16.88\% to be falsely
              inferred as absent. For BUSCO 1-to-1 orthologous families,
              18.30\% were falsely inferred to be absent. Finally, we showed
              that falsely inferred absences indeed impact loss estimates, with
              the number of losses decreasing by 11.78\%. Our work strengthens
              the increasing number of studies showing that gene loss is an
              important factor in eukaryotic genome evolution. However, while
              we demonstrate that on average inferring gene absences from
              predicted proteomes is reliable, caution is warranted when
              inferring species-specific absences.",

              the evolution of recombination suppression between sex
              chromosomes. However, empirical evidence to discriminate between
              different hypotheses is difficult to obtain. We report genetic
              mapping results in laboratory-raised families of the guppy
              (Poecilia reticulata), a sexually dimorphic fish with SA
              polymorphisms for male coloration genes, mostly on the sex
              chromosomes. Comparison of the genetic and physical maps shows
              that crossovers are distributed very differently in the two sexes
              (heterochiasmy); in male meiosis, they are restricted to the
              termini of all four chromosomes studied, including chromosome 12,
              which carries the sex-determining locus. Genome resequencing of
              male and female guppies from a population also indicates sex
              linkage of variants across almost the entire chromosome 12. More
              than 90\% of the chromosome carrying the male-determining locus
              is therefore transmitted largely through the male lineage. A lack
              of heterochiasmy in a related fish species suggests that it
              originated recently in the lineage leading to the guppy. Our
              findings do not support the hypothesis that suppressed
              recombination evolved in response to the presence of SA

  abstract = "Sex chromosomes have evolved independently in numerous animal and
              plant lineages. After recombination becomes suppressed between
              two homologous sex chromosomes, genes on the non-recombining Y
              chromosomes (and W chromosomes in ZW systems) undergo genetic
              degeneration, losing functions retained by their X- or Z-linked
              homologs, changing their expression, and becoming lost [1, 2].
              Adaptive changes may also occur, both on the non-recombining Y
              chromosome, to shut down expression of maladapted genes [3], and
              on the X chromosome (or the Z in ZW systems), which may evolve
              dosage compensation to increase low expression or compensate for
              poor protein function in the heterogametic sex [2, 4, 5].
              Although empirical approaches to studying genetic degeneration
              have been developed for model species [3, 6], the onset and
              dynamics of these changes are still poorly understood,
              particularly in de novo evolving sex chromosomes. Sex chromosomes
              of some plants evolved much more recently than those of mammals,
              birds, and Drosophila [7-9], making them suitable for studying
              the early stages of genetic degeneration in de novo evolving sex
              chromosomes. In plants, haploid selection should oppose gene loss
              from Y chromosomes, but recent work on sex chromosomes of two
              plant species has estimated that Y-linked transcripts are lacking
              for 10\%-30\% of X-linked genes [10-12]. Here, we provide
              evidence that, in Silene latifolia, this largely involved losses
              of Y-linked genes, and not suppressed expression of Y-linked
              alleles, or gene additions to the X chromosome. Our results also
              suggest that chromosome-wide dosage compensation does not occur

              after 8 years of effort, this result is based on analyses of five
              sex-linked gene sequences, and the maximum divergence (and thus
              the age of this plant's sex chromosome system) has remained
              uncertain. More genes are therefore needed. Here, by segregation
              analysis of intron size variants (ISVS) and single nucleotide

  abstract = "While short-read sequencing technology has resulted in a sharp
              increase in the number of species with genome assemblies, these
              assemblies are typically highly fragmented. Repeats pose the
              largest challenge for reference genome assembly, and
              pericentromeric regions and the repeat-rich Y chromosome are
              typically ignored from sequencing projects. Here, we assemble the
              genome of Drosophila miranda using long reads for contig
              formation, chromatin interaction maps for scaffolding and short
              reads, and optical mapping and bacterial artificial chromosome
              (BAC) clone sequencing for consensus validation. Our assembly
              recovers entire chromosomes and contains large fractions of
              repetitive DNA, including about 41.5 Mb of pericentromeric and
              telomeric regions, and >100 Mb of the recently formed highly
              repetitive neo-Y chromosome. While Y chromosome evolution is
              typically characterized by global sequence loss and shrinkage,
              the neo-Y increased in size by almost 3-fold because of the
              accumulation of repetitive sequences. Our high-quality assembly
              allows us to reconstruct the chromosomal events that have led to
              the unusual sex chromosome karyotype in D. miranda, including the
              independent de novo formation of a pair of sex chromosomes at two
              distinct time points, or the reversion of a former Y chromosome
              to an autosome.",

  abstract = "The reconstruction of the evolutionary history of sex
              determination in squamate reptiles (lizards and snakes) is
              complicated by missing data in many lineages, erroneous reports,
              and often questionable inferences on state homology. Therefore,
              despite the large effort, the reconstruction of the ancestral sex
              determination in squamate reptiles is still controversial. With
              the hope to shed light on this problem, we aspired to identify
              the sex chromosome gene content in Dibamus deharvengi, the
              representative of the family Dibamidae, the putative sister clade
              to all other squamates. Our analyses revealed XX/XY
              sex-determination system in D. deharvengi: the X chromosome
              contains genes with homologues scattered across chicken
              chromosomes 8, 12, 13, 18, 30, and 33, and the Y chromosome seems
              to largely degenerate. To the best of our knowledge, this
              combination has never been reported to form sex chromosomes in
              any amniote lineage. It suggests that the sex chromosomes can
              represent an apomorphy of a clade including D. deharvengi. Our
              findings cover an important gap in the knowledge of sex
              determination in reptiles and further support multiple
              independent origins of sex chromosomes in this group.",
