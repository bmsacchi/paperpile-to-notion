  abstract    = "Summary Sex chromosomes have evolved hundreds of independent
                 times across eukaryotes. As genome sequencing, assembly, and
                 scaffolding techniques rapidly improve, it is now feasible to
                 build fully phased sex chromosome assemblies. Despite
                 technological advances enabling phased assembly of whole
                 chromosomes, there are currently no standards for representing
                 sex chromosomes when publicly releasing a genome. Furthermore,
                 most computational analysis tools are unable to efficiently
                 investigate their unique biology relative to autosomes. We
                 discuss a diversity of sex chromosome systems and consider the
                 challenges of representing sex chromosome pairs in genome
                 assemblies. By addressing these issues now as technologies for
                 full phasing of chromosomal assemblies are maturing, we can
                 collectively ensure that future genome analysis toolkits can
                 be broadly applied to all eukaryotes with diverse types of sex
                 chromosome systems. Here we provide best practice guidelines
                 for presenting a genome assembly that contains sex
                 chromosomes. These guidelines can also be applied to other
                 non-recombining genomic regions, such as S-loci in plants and
                 mating-type loci in fungi and algae.",
