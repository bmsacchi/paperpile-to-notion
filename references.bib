              architecture of traits is a central goal of evolutionary genetics.
              Here, we investigate how quantitative trait variation accumulated
              over time in populations that colonized a novel environment. We
              compare the genetic architecture of flowering time in Arabidopsis
              populations from the drought-prone Cape Verde Islands and their
              closest outgroup population from North Africa. We find that trait
              polygenicity is severely reduced in the island populations
              compared to the continental North African population. Further,
              trait architectures and reconstructed allelic histories best fit a
              model of strong directional selection in the islands in accord
              with a Fisher-Orr adaptive walk. Consistent with this, we find
              that large-effect variants that disrupt major flowering time genes
              (FRI and FLC) arose first, followed by smaller effect variants,
              including ATX2 L125F, which is associated with a 4-day reduction
              in flowering time. The most recently arising flowering
              time-associated loci are not known to be directly involved in
              flowering time, consistent with an omnigenic signature developing
              as the population approaches its trait optimum. Surprisingly, we
              find no effect in the natural population of EDI-Cvi-0 (CRY2
              V367M), an allele for which an effect was previously validated by
              introgression into a Eurasian line. Instead, our results suggest
              the previously observed effect of the EDI-Cvi-0 allele on
              flowering time likely depends on genetic background, due to an
              epistatic interaction. Altogether, our results provide an
              empirical example of the effects demographic history and selection
              has on trait architecture.",

              face of gene flow depends on the strength and nature of selection
              acting on the underlying genetic loci. Floral pollination
              syndromes exemplify the evolution of trait combinations adaptive
              for particular pollinators. The North American wildflower genus
              Penstemon displays remarkable floral syndrome convergence, with at
              least 20 separate lineages that have evolved from ancestral bee
              pollination syndrome (wide blue-purple flowers that present a
              landing platform for bees and small amounts of nectar) to
              hummingbird pollination syndrome (bright red narrowly tubular
              flowers offering copious nectar). Related taxa that differ in
              floral syndrome offer an attractive opportunity to examine the
              genomic basis of complex trait divergence. In this study, we
              characterized genomic divergence among 229 individuals from a
              Penstemon species complex that includes both bee and hummingbird
              floral syndromes. Field plants are easily classified into species
              based on phenotypic differences and hybrids displaying
              intermediate floral syndromes are rare. Despite unambiguous
              phenotypic differences, genome-wide differentiation between
              species is minimal. Hummingbird-adapted populations are more
              genetically similar to nearby bee-adapted populations than to
              geographically distant hummingbird-adapted populations, in terms
              of genome-wide dXY. However, a small number of genetic loci are
              strongly differentiated between species. These approximately 20
              ``species-diagnostic loci,'' which appear to have nearly fixed
              differences between pollination syndromes, are sprinkled
              throughout the genome in high recombination regions. Several map
              closely to previously established floral trait quantitative trait
              loci (QTLs). The striking difference between the diagnostic loci
              and the genome as whole suggests strong selection to maintain
              distinct combinations of traits, but with sufficient gene flow to
              homogenize the genomic background. A surprisingly small number of
              alleles confer phenotypic differences that form the basis of

  abstract = "Y and W chromosomes often stop recombining and degenerate. Most
              work on recombination suppression has focused on the mechanisms
              favoring recombination arrest in the short term. Yet, the
              long-term maintenance of recombination suppression is critical to
              evolve heteromorphic sex chromosomes. This long-term maintenance
              has been little investigated. In the long term, recombination
              suppression may be maintained for selective reasons (e.g.
              involving the emergence of nascent dosage compensation), or due to
              mechanistic constraints preventing the reestablishment of
              recombination, for instance when complex chromosomal
              rearrangements evolve on the Y. In this paper, we investigate
              these ‘constraint’ theories. We show that they face a series of
              theoretical difficulties: they are not robust to extremely low
              rates of recombination restoration; they would rather cause
              population extinction than Y degeneration; they are less efficient
              at producing a non- recombining and degenerate Y than scenarios
              adding a selective pressure against recombination, whatever the
              rate of recombination restoration. Finally, whether such very high
              constraint really exist is questionable. Very low rates of
              recombination reestablishment are sufficient to prevent Y
              degeneration, given the large fitness advantage to recover a
              non-degenerate Y or W for the heterogametic sex. The assumption of
              a lack of genetic variation to restore recombination seems also
              implausible given known mechanisms to restore a recombining pair

              selection, which can, in turn, lead to local adaptation. Long-held
              views in evolutionary biology predict that environmental
              heterogeneity that is spatially autocorrelated will lead to
              stronger local adaptation than if it is not. Here I test this
              explicitly, combining analysis of a dataset from a large-scale
              provenance trial conducted on lodgepole pine with simulations
              modelling local adaptation. I find evidence that environmental
              heterogeneity that is spatially autocorrelated leads to stronger
              local adaptation in natural populations. Using simulations, I
              examine how the genetics of local adaptation are influenced by the
              spatial pattern of environmental heterogeneity. The simulations
              confirm that local adaptation increases with the degree of spatial
              autocorrelation in the selective environment, but also show that
              highly heterogeneous environments are more likely to exhibit high
              variation in local adaptation, a result not previously described.
              Spatial autocorrelation in the environment influences the genetic
              architecture of local adaptation, with different patterns of
              allele frequency and effect size arising under different patterns
              of environmental variation. These differences will likely impact
              the ability to study the genetic basis of local adaptation.
              Overall, this work emphasizes the profound importance that the
              spatial pattern of selection can have on the evolution and how
              spatial autocorrelation should be considered in ecological and
