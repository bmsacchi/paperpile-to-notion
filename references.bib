              in 1923. It has long been known that the Y consists mainly of a

              meiosis, and that this region carries the primary sex-determining

  abstract = "In the formation of species, adaptation by natural selection
              generates distinct combinations of traits that function well
              together. The maintenance of adaptive trait combinations in the
              face of gene flow depends on the strength and nature of selection
              acting on the underlying genetic loci. Floral pollination
              syndromes exemplify the evolution of trait combinations adaptive
              for particular pollinators. The North American wildflower genus
              Penstemon displays remarkable floral syndrome convergence, with
              at least 20 separate lineages that have evolved from ancestral
              bee pollination syndrome (wide blue-purple flowers that present a
              landing platform for bees and small amounts of nectar) to
              hummingbird pollination syndrome (bright red narrowly tubular
              flowers offering copious nectar). Related taxa that differ in
              floral syndrome offer an attractive opportunity to examine the
              genomic basis of complex trait divergence. In this study, we
              characterized genomic divergence among 229 individuals from a
              Penstemon species complex that includes both bee and hummingbird
              floral syndromes. Field plants are easily classified into species
              based on phenotypic differences and hybrids displaying
              intermediate floral syndromes are rare. Despite unambiguous
              phenotypic differences, genome-wide differentiation between
              species is minimal. Hummingbird-adapted populations are more
              genetically similar to nearby bee-adapted populations than to
              geographically distant hummingbird-adapted populations, in terms
              of genome-wide dXY. However, a small number of genetic loci are
              strongly differentiated between species. These approximately 20
              ``species-diagnostic loci,'' which appear to have nearly fixed
              differences between pollination syndromes, are sprinkled
              throughout the genome in high recombination regions. Several map
              closely to previously established floral trait quantitative trait
              loci (QTLs). The striking difference between the diagnostic loci
              and the genome as whole suggests strong selection to maintain
              distinct combinations of traits, but with sufficient gene flow to
              homogenize the genomic background. A surprisingly small number of
              alleles confer phenotypic differences that form the basis of
              species identity in this species complex.",

                 scaffolding techniques rapidly improve, it is now feasible to
                 build fully phased sex chromosome assemblies. Despite
                 technological advances enabling phased assembly of whole
                 chromosomes, there are currently no standards for representing
                 sex chromosomes when publicly releasing a genome. Furthermore,
                 most computational analysis tools are unable to efficiently
                 investigate their unique biology relative to autosomes. We
                 discuss a diversity of sex chromosome systems and consider the
                 challenges of representing sex chromosome pairs in genome
                 assemblies. By addressing these issues now as technologies for
                 full phasing of chromosomal assemblies are maturing, we can
                 collectively ensure that future genome analysis toolkits can
                 be broadly applied to all eukaryotes with diverse types of sex
                 chromosome systems. Here we provide best practice guidelines

  abstract = "Environmental heterogeneity can lead to spatially varying
              selection, which can, in turn, lead to local adaptation.
              Long-held views in evolutionary biology predict that
              environmental heterogeneity that is spatially autocorrelated will
              lead to stronger local adaptation than if it is not. Here I test
              this explicitly, combining analysis of a dataset from a
              large-scale provenance trial conducted on lodgepole pine with
              simulations modelling local adaptation. I find evidence that
              environmental heterogeneity that is spatially autocorrelated
              leads to stronger local adaptation in natural populations. Using
              simulations, I examine how the genetics of local adaptation are
              influenced by the spatial pattern of environmental heterogeneity.
              The simulations confirm that local adaptation increases with the
              degree of spatial autocorrelation in the selective environment,
              but also show that highly heterogeneous environments are more
              likely to exhibit high variation in local adaptation, a result
              not previously described. Spatial autocorrelation in the
              environment influences the genetic architecture of local
              adaptation, with different patterns of allele frequency and
              effect size arising under different patterns of environmental
              variation. These differences will likely impact the ability to
              study the genetic basis of local adaptation. Overall, this work
              emphasizes the profound importance that the spatial pattern of
              selection can have on the evolution and how spatial
              autocorrelation should be considered in ecological and genetic
