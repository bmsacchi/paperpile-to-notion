  abstract = "To test hypotheses about the evolution of massive sex-linked
              regions in plants, we sequenced the genome of Silene latifolia ,
              whose giant heteromorphic sex chromosomes were first discovered
              in 1923. It has long been known that the Y consists mainly of a
              male-specific region which does not recombine with the X in male
              meiosis, and that this region carries the primary sex-determining
              genes, and other genes contributing to male functioning. However,
              only with a whole Y chromosome assembly can the candidates be
              validated experimentally, as we describe. Our new results also
              illuminate the genomic changes as the ancestral chromosome
              evolved into the current XY pair, testing ideas about why large
              regions of sex-linkage evolve, and the mechanisms creating the
              present recombination pattern. One sentence summary Based on the
              whole genome sequences of Silene latifolia , a model species for
              plant sex chromosome evolution, we describe discovery of genes
              underlying male-female flower differences, and relate the results
              to ideas about the evolution of the vast non-recombining regions
              of the Y chromosome. \#\#\# Competing Interest Statement The

  abstract    = "Summary Sex chromosomes have evolved hundreds of independent
                 times across eukaryotes. As genome sequencing, assembly, and
                 scaffolding techniques rapidly improve, it is now feasible to
                 build fully phased sex chromosome assemblies. Despite
                 technological advances enabling phased assembly of whole
                 chromosomes, there are currently no standards for representing
                 sex chromosomes when publicly releasing a genome. Furthermore,
                 most computational analysis tools are unable to efficiently
                 investigate their unique biology relative to autosomes. We
                 discuss a diversity of sex chromosome systems and consider the
                 challenges of representing sex chromosome pairs in genome
                 assemblies. By addressing these issues now as technologies for
                 full phasing of chromosomal assemblies are maturing, we can
                 collectively ensure that future genome analysis toolkits can
                 be broadly applied to all eukaryotes with diverse types of sex
                 chromosome systems. Here we provide best practice guidelines
                 for presenting a genome assembly that contains sex
                 chromosomes. These guidelines can also be applied to other
                 non-recombining genomic regions, such as S-loci in plants and
                 mating-type loci in fungi and algae.",

  abstract = "Environmental heterogeneity can lead to spatially varying
              selection, which can, in turn, lead to local adaptation.
              Long-held views in evolutionary biology predict that
              environmental heterogeneity that is spatially autocorrelated will
              lead to stronger local adaptation than if it is not. Here I test
              this explicitly, combining analysis of a dataset from a
              large-scale provenance trial conducted on lodgepole pine with
              simulations modelling local adaptation. I find evidence that
              environmental heterogeneity that is spatially autocorrelated
              leads to stronger local adaptation in natural populations. Using
              simulations, I examine how the genetics of local adaptation are
              influenced by the spatial pattern of environmental heterogeneity.
              The simulations confirm that local adaptation increases with the
              degree of spatial autocorrelation in the selective environment,
              but also show that highly heterogeneous environments are more
              likely to exhibit high variation in local adaptation, a result
              not previously described. Spatial autocorrelation in the
              environment influences the genetic architecture of local
              adaptation, with different patterns of allele frequency and
              effect size arising under different patterns of environmental
              variation. These differences will likely impact the ability to
              study the genetic basis of local adaptation. Overall, this work
              emphasizes the profound importance that the spatial pattern of
              selection can have on the evolution and how spatial
              autocorrelation should be considered in ecological and genetic
              studies of local adaptation. \#\#\# Competing Interest Statement
